The result: upwards of $10k/employee/year spent on regulatory compliance and thousands of hours of tedious tasks at each financial firm.

Prompts are delivered in response to what is happening in a conversation. The goal of these prompts is to get more reps achieving quota and to reduce the time it takes to start attaining quota.

Prompts are action-oriented steps toward empathetic listening and effective discovery. Examples include 'pause' (when talking too much), 'set next steps' (when wrapping up a call without them), and 'ask current state' (when encountering objections).

Trellus is backed by Y Combinator and founded by former MIT researchers.",W22,Active,"['AI-Enhanced Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'SaaS', 'B2B', 'Sales']",New York,US,2022.0,2.0,"['Ajinkya Nene', 'Craig Bonnoit']",3.0,https://www.trellus.ai,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/trytrellus/about/,"AI Cold Call Coach | Trellus Auto Dialer About Packaging Blog Contact us Install Extension Book more meetings on your cold calls Trellus uses real-time analytics to provide sales reps with a personalized AI sales coach on each and every call.

Ethan Rausenberger Enterprise BDR @Contentful ""Since Trellus, I go into calls knowing I won't get stuck without a question to ask, without something to check my pace, and without knowing what my prospect *means* on the other end. I can feel comfortable Trellus will reliably capture insights for me and my team so we can improve our skills and comfortably tackle our prospect's next touch."" Shawn Kipnis ADE @OpenText ""I absolutely cannot live without Trellus. The pace feature is great and tells you when to slow down. Other great benefits are it does research about your prospect now, it transcribes the whole conversation, and it helps with objections as well. Recently I booked a meeting but wrote down the prospects email address. I left my notebook at the office but with Trellus I knew I had the transcription of the call and that email! Disaster to go back to the office averted."" Keith Loh Founding SDR @Novata ""I’ve been loving the new AI research feature of the tool that pulls up a summary of the prospect - specifically around what my ICP would invest in."" Emily Maguire RDR @Funnel ""Being passionate about our product can lead me to talk very quickly sometimes, so getting real-time alerts from Trellus to slow down helps me focus on key points and not overwhelm prospects. I've noticed over time that I am naturally speaking slower on cold calls ! Looking back at transcripts helps me also reflect on what I could have done differently in hindsight, and when I should change tactics."" Tamina Sabnani SDR @CleverTap ""I've never had proper cold call training so Trellus has helped me tremendously with being able to go back and review calls, by telling me when I'm speaking too quickly (something I do a lot), and with the real time voice transcripts that have saved me on numerous occasions where I didn't hear what the prospect said and got to read it instead of asking them to repeat themselves."" Alex Bensley SDR @Cognism ""Trellus allows me to read what the prospect is saying while they are saying it, which helps because sometimes it's hard for me to retain everything by listening alone. It even suggests questions to ask during the conversation! Also, I love the call reports Trellus sends back, providing me with the most common objections received, average cadence with prospect, and more. Seriously, Trellus is awesome "" Zacharias Lind Public Sector SDR @Snowflake ""Trellus adds value not just to me, but to my prospects as well. Instead of entering a call with poorly maintained Salesforce notes of our our previous conversations, Trellus gives me a summary of exactly what we talked about and how we left off. This has helped me deliver more personalized conversations that resonate with prospects."" Jasmine Agius ENT Solutions Consultant @Rubrik ""I love how it sets up a draft email for me I can just copy and paste! It is pretty accurate in scripting everything that's said so I don't really have to take notes, which saves a bunch of time. "" Zach Day Senior SDR @Relevize “I think for me the biggest value I've seen is the objection handling tips and the speaking pace indicator . I have the tendency to speak quickly when I'm on a call and having that indicator tell me to slow down and really articulate the message I'm trying to get across has been helpful. The objection handling tips are a great reminder of the types of coaching we all get from managers, but to have those tips pop up live on my screen as I'm having a conversation helps me sound relaxed and confident in overturning those objections.” 1 click install.

- **Unique Value Proposition (UVP):** Ok for 1-2 years
- **Database Uniqueness:** Not Special/Publicly Available

### Rationale:

**UVP - Ok for 1-2 years:**
- While the idea of a search engine that provides answers instead of just links through generative AI is innovative, it is likely that more companies will enter this space and offer similar functionalities within the next few years. This can potentially make the unique value proposition less compelling as other similar or improved solutions become available.

**Database Uniqueness - Not Special/Publicly Available:**
- The data used to generate answers appears to be derived from a combination of publicly available sources and live data. There is no indication that the data utilized by Andi is unique or difficult to obtain. Thus, the database does not present a significant uniqueness or difficulty to replicate.",,

24615.0,Synth,Second brain for knowledge workers,"We are building a second brain for knowledge workers. Our app captures all the relevant information you consume - text, audio, video and summarizes it 1-click. It also makes it easy to search and retrieve the information you want, wherever you like.

All co-founders know each other since 2019 and met at a one-year AI fellowship. Since their time at the fellowship, they have felt frustrated creating their second brain while shifting between apps like Roam Research, and Obsidian. These applications were burdening them to do all three tasks of capturing, organizing, and retrieving, making the cost to value ratio of setting up the second brain really high. They decided to solve this and want to shift the burden of these steps on to software, making it easier for a user to build their second brain.

Tavus for Sales & Marketing Hey, Hasaan. I was talking with Quinn and they said you should totally check out Tavus, whatever that means. Hey, I’m just the messenger. This video was auto-generated by the company Tavus. We make personalized videos so you don’t have to. See ya! @first_name @company_name @anything @city @ai_snippet @position Most effective outreach strategy Engagement is your most valuable asset. Competing for milliseconds of distracted attention used to be painful, exhausting and time consuming. With Tavus videos, you transcend the noise at mind-blowing scale. How it Works Get Started Create one-on-one connections with thousands of people. Boost conversions by 5x But sitting and recording hundreds of tailor-made videos? You’ve got better things to do. You only have to record once. This becomes your template, which is easily customized so each video feels completely personal for each recipient. 1:1 for them. 1 to many for you. Tavus then auto-generates hundreds or thousands of videos. Whatever the scale, every video will be unique. Become a familiar face. Tavus uses advanced cloning technology so it’s your face, voice, and message building personal connections with your audience – every time. AI + human innovation = revolutionary ROI. AI video helps your company develop meaningful new sources of value by freeing up your team’s capacity for creativity, problem-solving, and growing big ideas. Tavus campaigns have increased our effectiveness way more than expected. Moving towards a friendly face makes everything more trustworthy. Literally the difference between stone tablets and an episode of THE JETSONS. Mike Monroe Digital Strategy Manager I used Tavus for large amounts of cold outreach.

The company plans to create the next generation of personal computing tools that act as a portal for new experiences directly in a human's mind, thereby enabling individuals to upgrade their cognition.",W21,Active,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Hardware', 'Neurotechnology']",San Francisco,US,2019.0,2.0,"['Ekram Alam', 'Jack Baber']",10.0,https://www.mindportal.com,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/37420648/,"MindPortal - Making Humanity Telepathic Home Mission Problem Solution Philosophy Contact Menu Home Mission Problem Solution Philosophy Contact At MindPortal , we’re pioneering human-AI telepathy. MindPortal has been featured in: Our  Team & Collaborators hail from: WINNER OF IMPACT 2023: Innovation of the Year Award Our mission is to enable
seamless telepathic
communication between
humans and AI. Revolutionising Human-AI Interactions. At MindPortal, we’re shaping the future of human-AI communication. No more typing, clicking, or speaking. Simply think. Our cutting-edge technology enables humans to communicate with AI using thoughts, pioneering a world where telepathic communication with AI via neural interfaces are the norm. Neural Interface Definition: A neural interface, also known as a brain-computer interface, empowers direct communication between the human mind and external digital platforms. With MindPortal’s groundbreaking, non-invasive technology, we’re pioneering the future of human-AI telepathic communication. The AI Communication Challenge. As AI evolves, becoming more sophisticated and inching closer to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), our methods of interaction must keep pace. Using slow, cumbersome communication tools (like typing) with such advanced systems would be akin to trying to navigate a spaceship using bicycle handles. Depth, nuance, and full fidelity in conveying our ideas become paramount. A constrained communication channel inevitably hampers the full spectrum of benefits we might draw from these systems. ""Difficulty getting your thoughts across will soon cease to exist."" Ekram Alam, Co-founder & CEO at MindPortal MindPortal is pioneering a non-surgical wearable which enables telepathic communication between humans and AI. [Images shown are a rendering of a potential future design]. Telepathic Communication
with AI Through Advanced
Neural Interfaces. MindPortal develops state-of-the-art, non-invasive neural interfaces which bypass traditional speech and text inputs, connecting directly to the very fabric of human cognition. Our neural interface is designed to allow users to engage with AI with real-time thought. The result? A bitrate of information transfer which renders traditional methods obsolete. MindPortal has developed a successful proof of concept device which facilitates thought-to-text dialogues with leading-edge AI platforms like ChatGPT. The user thinks in sentences and their imagined speech is telepathically relayed to the AI. While “brain-machine interfaces” often evoke visions of invasive measures, MindPortal’s technology is being built with human anatomy, personal privacy and safety in mind. Leveraging the brain’s topographical evolution, we extract necessary information from surface layers, eliminating the need for invasive procedures. This ensures our approach is not only revolutionary but also accessible. Our Philosophy 1 We are optimistic about the future of AI and the development of artificial general intelligence. 2 We believe that technology has the ability to expand human capabilities and potential. 3 We believe that a future where humans and AI work symbiotically has the potential to herald a golden era which benefits humanity. 4 We think that by improving the bandwidth between humans and AI e.g. through human-AI telepathic communication, we can expand the potential of this symbiotic relationship. 5 By doing so, we think that humanity will advance towards a future of ever expanding possibilities and abundance. The founders of MindPortal during a live Q&A in Tokyo, Japan, answering questions about human-AI telepathy.

A lot of platforms prioritize speed over quality or quality over speed. Encord speeds up annotation while still allowing for strong quality control. Camilla Gilchrist Operations Director We plan on leveraging Encord to expand the range of use cases and include more medical conditions in our solutions… We are excited about our potential with Encord and look forward to seeing how we will evolve together in the future. Maayan Gerbi Clinical AI Specialist We now have an integrated, one-stop solution where we can manage our data and also understand our model performance to create feedback mechanisms to improve data and models. Prajwal Kotamraju Head of CV Encord’s DICOM annotation tool captures the shape of the pathology, interpolating the label on the slices the annotators skipped. In a case with 100 slices, annotators only have to label about 30 images. Dr. Ryan Mason Neuradiologist Using Encord’s platform, we were able to train our new models on much better datasets with much higher quality labels, reducing our false acceptance rate to only one percent. Jeffrey Siaw VP of Data Science ... we know we can do that (annotate 100 hours of videos in four months) with Encord because of the whole process that we have, which compared to what we had before, it would be one procedure every two months even, much slower. Margaux Masson-Forsythe Director of Machine Learning Before, using clinicians to annotate precancerous polyp videos had prohibitively high costs because of the large number of datasets needed to train the model. With Encord, we annotated the data over six times faster than using traditional methods.

13330.0,Recurrency,Automated ERP for distributors.,"Recurrency is reversing enterprise resource planning (ERP) stagnation by building the industry-standard ERP automation platform: blazingly fast and complete with powerful automation tools like intelligent sales recommendations, dynamic pricing, and demand forecasting. Despite distribution being a multi-trillion dollar industry, the legacy ERP systems that exist to help businesses manage their purchasing, inventory, sales, order processing, and accounting are decades behind.

Vote B FAQs What is an AI text generator, exactly? An AI text generator is a software tool that helps you create content like blog articles, product descriptions and marketing copy. You provide Hypotenuse AI with some context such as product feature, or a topic to write about, and the AI software will take that to write a piece of content for you. It's like having an assistant who can respond to you instantly. Some people might be hesitant to try an AI writing assistant because they're unsure of its legitimacy, or afraid of plagiarism issues. Not to worry—each piece of AI copy and writing is written from scratch each time. With a free trial available, why not try it out for yourself to verify that? We've had great feedback from users who have seen a 38% increase in website traffic and engagement metrics. ‍ How does an AI text generator work? Our AI text generator works by first determining the type of content you'd like to create. It then analyzes and extracts the important factors based on your input. Once it understands the topic and tone you’re aiming for, it'll get to work writing a high-quality, unique article, product description or ad copy for you. You’ll be able to review and edit the generated text as you see fit, before it’s published on your site or blog. The content you get will always be unique as the AI text generator has a large range of vocabulary and deep understanding of sentence structures. To learn more, you can read our deep dive into AI copywriting . What can an AI writing generator do for me? You can use our AI writing generator for a variety of purposes, including blog posts, website articles, social media posts, and more. These include: Article titles Article outlines Article introductions Article conclusions Article body paragraphs Product descriptions in various styles Google ad copy Instagram captions Image to Instagram captions Facebook ad copy Website headlines SEO Outlines More types of AI writing are constantly being added, so let us know if there's anything that you'd like to see. Will content writing be fully automated by AI writing generator? Short answer: In the short term, no. Long answer: Our AI writing tool isn't a fully automated solution just yet, and human oversight and editing will always be necessary for quality content. You can expect to have a lot of control over the final product, so you can be sure that your voice and tone come through loud and clear. We often get the question: Can AI text generators ever replace content writers? We believe that copywriting is both art and science, so nope—there's no replacing the human touch. However, our AI text generator can help brainstorm alongside you and give you a first draft curated for your target audience. You can then spend more time on what you're best at: bringing your own special insight into great content. How much does an AI writing assistant cost? You can expect to pay a monthly subscription fee for an AI writing assistant—this fee depends on the volume of content you generate and any additional features you need. ‍ Our pricing starts from $29/month with no minimum lock in. If you’re looking to build custom templates or AI models trained on your company’s brand voice, you should consider our Enterprise plans. ‍ Can AI writing ever be free? It costs money to get the AI writer to analyze and generate text (called an 'inference' in machine-learning terms), so unlike other software tools, it's unlikely that AI text generation will ever become free. What languages do you support with AI writing? Hypotenuse currently supports: English (UK, US & Canadian), Bulgarian, Chinese (Simplified & Traditional), Czech Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French (French & Canadian), German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Portugese & Brazilian), Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish (Spanish & Latin America), Swedish, Tagalog (Filipino), Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Ukranian.

Ello helps early readers break down learning barriers by combining artificial intelligence and speech recognition technology to make Ello come to life. Ello is a revolutionary state-of-the-art interactive reading buddy who listens to your child read out loud. Ello provides support when your child needs help reading, gentle corrections when they make errors, and motivation to keep your child engaged. Appropriately leveled books will be automatically loaded into the app for you! How does my child use Ello? Your child will simply log into the app and choose a book to start reading. If they need help with a word, they can tap on the word for help from Ello. How does Ello keep my child engaged? As your child reads, Ello brings the story to life, provides words of encouragement, and helps them if they get stuck so they don't get frustrated. We use behavioral psychology and a growth mindset paradigm to keep your child encouraged, help their confidence soar, and build a love of reading. Ello offers a reward system as well. In this system, children collect stars and badges, leading up to a completion prize that is either delivered digitally, included in the next box, or both! My child is reading the words wrong but Ello isn’t correcting them. What’s going on? Since children can get easily discouraged, Ello leans on the lenient side. We recommend sitting with your child when they read and helping with some of these corrections yourself. Is Ello good for kids with dyslexia? Ello’s instructional method was developed by reading specialists with backgrounds in dyslexia intervention and uses direct, explicit, and sequential phonics instruction. This is exactly what research shows works for helping children with dyslexia learn how to read. Ello is not a comprehensive curriculum or intervention model for dyslexia, it’s a great supplement and we have numerous children with dyslexia using Ello with great success. What literacy strategies do you use to support my child? Ello uses proven, phonics-based reading strategies to help your child decode words and develop fluency. What device is required for Ello? The Ello app works on iPads running iOS 16 and newer. For a complete list, click here . Please note that Ello does not currently work on laptops or desktop computers or phones. Other questions? Email support@helloello.com or text (415) 214 8119 What kind of books are in the app? We offer books that are level-appropriate, inclusive, and engaging. Where do your books come from? Our physical books are mostly favorite classics. We get them from publishers and you might even already own some of them. Our e-books in the Ello app come from a special team of authors who specialize in reading education. They are created with the science of reading in mind. What types of physical books do you send? Every box of books has to meet three criteria: ‍ Highly engaging Just the right level for your child’s reading ability Match common age-based interests ‍ We believe that fantastic books create enthusiastic readers and we work with reading specialists to source classic beloved books and new undiscovered gems. The best part is that we take the guesswork out of finding books that are ""just right"" for your child – ones that are not too easy and not too hard. How do you determine my child's reading level? We make it easy! We’ll take you through a short series of questions in our onboarding process. We use your answers to determine your child’s estimated reading level and reach out if we have any questions. As your child completes each level, they will automatically progress to more difficult books. If the books are ever too easy or hard, please let us know and we can help change their reading level.‍ What does it mean that a book is ‘just right’ for my child? ‍ If a child is reading on the appropriate level, they should make 1-10 mistakes per book. Any more than this and we find they get frustrated and overwhelmed. Less mistakes and we find they get bored and aren’t engaged. By answering a few short questions, we can help determine your child’s appropriate developmental reading level. We are also happy to set the reading level to whatever they are reading at school, as determined by their teacher. The books are too hard or too easy. How do I change the reading level for my child? No problem! We want each child to have the best experience possible. This means making sure they are reading on the right level for their abilities. Please email or text Customer Support and we will be happy to make any adjustments you may need. When I unlock new books, will we still be able to read the old ones? Yes! The books will stay available in the app so you can enjoy them over and over again. Other questions? Email support@helloello.com or text (415) 214 8119 What data do you collect? If you choose to allow it, we process the audio of your child reading so that Ello can provide real-time support and motivation, and so your child can access certain features of the app, such as listening to themselves read. Separately, you can opt-in to give us access to this data so that we can improve Ello. ‍ We also collect data of your child's progress to provide the service (for example the rewards). ‍ Finally, we collect anonymous and aggregated usage data. See our privacy policy for full details. What do you do with the data you collect? It is up to you on what data we collect - it is optional. You will be asked if you would like to opt-in to data collection after downloading the app. ‍ All data is anonymous and aggregated and used to improve the product. Do you sell the data that you collect? No. Never. Do you have ads in the app? No. Never. How secure is the data you collect? It's very secure. We use industry-leading encryption and security. Other questions? Email support@helloello.com or text (415) 214 8119 When does the box ship? In most cases, your first Ello box will ship the business day after your order or monthly renewal. Occasionally, we may have some questions about your child’s reading level or your shipping address. If that is the case, we will reach out by email. We will also send an email confirmation with a tracking link so you can watch the shipment of your box. Once sent, you should receive your box within 2-8 business days via USPS Media Mail.

                line of code. But as you do more complex things, you fine-tune
                models or deploy your own custom code. Run open-source models Our community has already published thousands of models that
                    are ready to use in production. You can run these with one

                    create new models that are better suited to specific tasks. Image models like SDXL can generate images of a particular
                    person, object, or style. Fine-tune image models Language models like Llama 2 generate text in a specific
