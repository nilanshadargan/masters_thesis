Humand brings us together. Leticia Fenoglio CEO & Co-founder of Rapanui/Franui Humand is part of a passing train. It's not just large, resourceful organizations that need to get on board; small ones need to do so as well. Nowadays, you either get on or you get left behind. There's a transformation on the horizon, and people are demanding that transformation. Alejandro Salvarezza HR Director - Swiss Medical Group We needed to have a versatile and dynamic intranet, where the collaborator could easily access through his cell phone to stay in touch with everyone inside the company.  With Humand we achieved that. Roberto Acosta HR Director - Farmashop I find the private social network interesting and I like the possibility that collaborators have to tell their stories. It fosters a more emotional bond between them.
Also, reaching 3,500 people at the same time and with the same information, it is something that adds a lot of value to our communication. Hernan Scotti HR Director - Dia Supermarkets We found in Humand a user-friendly HR platform that is easy to manage and very agile, as it makes room for continuous improvements and finding new solutions. Marcelo Melamed EVP of Human Resources - Cirion Technologies Humand was just what we were looking for to optimize and centralize processes, and internal communication. We highly value the willingness and ability of the Humand team to adapt to our particular needs and consider our suggestions for improvement, which translates into benefits. Aldo Fenoglio CEO - Rapanui Inside Humand, people share knowledge, ask questions, stay informed, recognize each other for good reasons, access important files, and complete surveys. All with a gamified experience. Mario Adaro Minister of the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza Humand improved the work environment and fostered relationships among colleagues. Gustavo Nadales Former HR Director - ArcelorMittal Acindar With Humand, I feel that my voice and opinion matter. Now I can share the progress of my work to inspire others and receive feedback from my colleagues. Jorge Maristany Internal Communication Analyst - ArcelorMittal I would recommend Humand because it is highly competitive compared to similar tools in the market. We have an HR platform with everything we need, and all the people in the company are connected in one channel at the same time. Teresa Jofre Fuentes Head of Internal Communications - Swiss Medical Group With Humand, we centralize all the digital experience of our company's personnel on one platform.

25314,Trellus,Real-time sales coach for SDRs ,"Trellus delivers simple coaching prompts to your salespeople in real time as they speak to prospects. Prompts are delivered in response to what is happening in a conversation. The goal of these prompts is to get more reps achieving quota and to reduce the time it takes to start attaining quota.

Prompts are action-oriented steps toward empathetic listening and effective discovery. Examples include 'pause' (when talking too much), 'set next steps' (when wrapping up a call without them), and 'ask current state' (when encountering objections).

Trellus is backed by Y Combinator and founded by former MIT researchers.",W22,Active,"['AI-Enhanced Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'SaaS', 'B2B', 'Sales']",New York,US,2022.0,2,"['Ajinkya Nene', 'Craig Bonnoit']",3.0,https://www.trellus.ai,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/trytrellus/about/,"AI Cold Call Coach | Trellus Auto Dialer About Packaging Blog Contact us Install Extension Book more meetings on your cold calls Trellus uses real-time analytics to provide sales reps with a personalized AI sales coach on each and every call.

Ello is not a comprehensive curriculum or intervention model for dyslexia, it‚Äôs a great supplement and we have numerous children with dyslexia using Ello with great success. What literacy strategies do you use to support my child? Ello uses proven, phonics-based reading strategies to help your child decode words and develop fluency. What device is required for Ello? The Ello app works on iPads running iOS 16 and newer. For a complete list, click here . Please note that Ello does not currently work on laptops or desktop computers or phones. Other questions? Email support@helloello.com or text (415) 214 8119 What kind of books are in the app? We offer books that are level-appropriate, inclusive, and engaging. Where do your books come from? Our physical books are mostly favorite classics. We get them from publishers and you might even already own some of them. Our e-books in the Ello app come from a special team of authors who specialize in reading education. They are created with the science of reading in mind. What types of physical books do you send? Every box of books has to meet three criteria: ‚Äç Highly engaging Just the right level for your child‚Äôs reading ability Match common age-based interests ‚Äç We believe that fantastic books create enthusiastic readers and we work with reading specialists to source classic beloved books and new undiscovered gems. The best part is that we take the guesswork out of finding books that are ""just right"" for your child ‚Äì ones that are not too easy and not too hard. How do you determine my child's reading level? We make it easy! We‚Äôll take you through a short series of questions in our onboarding process. We use your answers to determine your child‚Äôs estimated reading level and reach out if we have any questions. As your child completes each level, they will automatically progress to more difficult books. If the books are ever too easy or hard, please let us know and we can help change their reading level.‚Äç What does it mean that a book is ‚Äòjust right‚Äô for my child? ‚Äç If a child is reading on the appropriate level, they should make 1-10 mistakes per book. Any more than this and we find they get frustrated and overwhelmed. Less mistakes and we find they get bored and aren‚Äôt engaged. By answering a few short questions, we can help determine your child‚Äôs appropriate developmental reading level. We are also happy to set the reading level to whatever they are reading at school, as determined by their teacher. The books are too hard or too easy. How do I change the reading level for my child? No problem! We want each child to have the best experience possible. This means making sure they are reading on the right level for their abilities. Please email or text Customer Support and we will be happy to make any adjustments you may need. When I unlock new books, will we still be able to read the old ones? Yes! The books will stay available in the app so you can enjoy them over and over again. Other questions? Email support@helloello.com or text (415) 214 8119 What data do you collect? If you choose to allow it, we process the audio of your child reading so that Ello can provide real-time support and motivation, and so your child can access certain features of the app, such as listening to themselves read. Separately, you can opt-in to give us access to this data so that we can improve Ello. ‚Äç We also collect data of your child's progress to provide the service (for example the rewards). ‚Äç Finally, we collect anonymous and aggregated usage data. See our privacy policy for full details. What do you do with the data you collect? It is up to you on what data we collect - it is optional. You will be asked if you would like to opt-in to data collection after downloading the app. ‚Äç All data is anonymous and aggregated and used to improve the product. Do you sell the data that you collect? No. Never. Do you have ads in the app? No. Never. How secure is the data you collect? It's very secure. We use industry-leading encryption and security. Other questions? Email support@helloello.com or text (415) 214 8119 When does the box ship? In most cases, your first Ello box will ship the business day after your order or monthly renewal. Occasionally, we may have some questions about your child‚Äôs reading level or your shipping address. If that is the case, we will reach out by email. We will also send an email confirmation with a tracking link so you can watch the shipment of your box. Once sent, you should receive your box within 2-8 business days via USPS Media Mail. Other questions? Email support@helloello.com or text (415) 214 8119 Designed by experts to maximize your child‚Äôs reading potential We did all the research so you don‚Äôt have to.

Now, AI is doing the same for the nervous system and BIOS is at the forefront, building the infrastructure on which future neural treatments will be discovered, developed, and delivered. ‚Äã The brain sends our bodies vast amounts of information every second of every day, but when those signals are faulty it can cause our organs and systems to malfunction, causing disease. BIOS has developed neural interfaces and AI that, for the first time, can read and write the body‚Äôs neural data, or ‚Äòcode‚Äô, to understand and correct those signals in real-time. ‚Äã BIOS envisions a new field of digital health treatments that use this new data-driven insight from the nervous system to create better, more targeted medicine. Neural digital therapies will use our read/write software to understand the effects on the nerves, leading to more precise creation of pharmaceuticals and software-delivered treatments direct to the nervous system. Autonomic Therapy REAL-TIME INSIGHTS With our proprietary neural interface and AI platform, BIOS has the unique ability to measure and analyse neural data in real-time in both acute and chronic settings. NEURAL BIOMARKERS BIOS has developed a programming language or 'code' for the nervous system that can be used for discovering groundbreaking insights into diseases, and creating new treatments. PRECISION HEALTH Neural digital therapeutics are created by using real-time feedback from the nervous system. This makes better, more targeted drugs, and opens the door for software-delivered therapies. HUMAN TECHNOLOGY We envision a future where we have control over our bodies and lives, enabling radically improved, seamlessly experienced healthcare. We want a better quality of life for everyone living with lifelong conditions. ECG RESPIRATORY PRESSURE BLOOD GLUCOSE Tech NEURAL CONTROL OF THE HEART Cardiovascular diseases are responsible for a third of all deaths globally. BIOS has launched the Autonomic Therapy Initiative (ATI) to discover more about the causal links with the nervous system and to drive forward neural therapies and treatments that could help millions of people.

29157,Orbio Earth,Tracking methane emissions with satellites,"Orbio Earth has developed a software platform that uses satellites to monitor methane emissions from the energy industry. 
Mismanagement of methane emissions triggers stock devaluations, stranded assets and increases global warming.

Stanford CASE¬†STUDY How Orbio Earth creates market-leading emissions data with global, asset-level satellite imagery We‚Äôve found ways to extract the methane signal from satellite data that allows us to scan every oil & gas facility in the globe every couple of days. Key to this has been ensuring our data is the highest quality, and our recent study with Stanford University was a validation of these efforts. The problem The Underreported Crisis of Methane Emissions Financial and energy sectors rely on generic emission calculation methods making it difficult to manage risks rising from methane regulation sweeping the globe. There are 12 million oil & gas facilities globally capable of emitting methane emissions, and a huge amount go under the radar. Traditional methods fall short in accurately reporting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, leading to a staggering underreporting of up to 70%. ‚Äç As the world braces for stringent regulations with significant financial repercussions, such as the impending IRA methane fee in the US and forthcoming EU regulation , the immediate need for precision in methane emission benchmarking has never been more critical. Our partners and collaborators Frequently asked questions How does the Orbio Earth platform work? Orbio utilises satellite data to capture images of methane every 4 days from any site on earth. We then reconcile this satellite emissions data with emission factor datasets to provide better emission benchmarks of assets, companies and supply chains . Why is understanding methane emissions important? Reducing man-made methane emissions are a win for both the climate and companies in the energy and financial sectors. Stopping these emissions from the energy industry alone could prevent 0.2¬∞C of global warming. To put that into perspective, it would be like taking all cars and trucks off the road globally. Preventing these emissions are surprisingly simple when stakeholders are equipped with the right data. How is Orbio Earth different? Firstly Orbio can deliver data at high spatial resolutions meaning emissions can be attributed to specific assets . The main methane-specific satellite in use today gives regional scale resolutions making it very difficult to gauge where the source of methane emissions are coming from. Secondly, Orbio has begun reconciling emissions data with non-emission datasets to inform how existing reporting efforts and aid with risk identification . How can I get involved with Orbio Earth? We are open to any connections! Find us on Linkedin, Crunchbase and Twitter, or drop us a line on info@orbio.earth, we are always keen on talking to people who are interested in tackling the methane problem. Why are current methane emission estimates so inaccurate Because estimating methane emissions is very difficult! There are three main reasons for this: 1. The nature of events are quite random , it can be from a leaking valve to a maintenance event, to a blowout. 2. There are 12 million energy assets worldwide that can emit methane . Therefore it's difficult to capture accurate data about emissions across such large scales. 3. Lastly, the majority of methane emissions are un-reported events , therefore, usually, they are not taken into account by current estimates. What sort of business risks can methane emissions create There are three examples that can be pointed to here: ‚Äç 1. Regulatory Pressure is increasing - after CO26 and the Global methane pledge, which 100 countries signed, methane regulations are being introduced creating transitional risks for companies. This transitional risk and regulatory pressure is in turn leading to shareholders pressuring businesses to better account for methane in their supply chain. 2. Unaccounted methane emissions can lead to drops in company valuations. Diversified energy recently suffered a $300m drop in its share price after it was found to have higher methane emissions in its supply chain than reported. 3. Companies are backing out of purchasing decisions based on methane emission risk.

Banking services provided by Thread Bank, Member FDIC. The Every Visa Business Debit Card is issued by Thread Bank, pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. and may be used anywhere Visa cards are accepted. For Every customers with deposit accounts on Thread Bank, your deposits qualify for up to a maximum of $2,500,000 in FDIC insurance coverage when placed at program banks in the Thread Bank deposit sweep program. Your deposits at each program bank become eligible for FDIC insurance up to $250,000, inclusive of any other deposits you may already hold at the bank in the same ownership capacity. You can access the terms and conditions of the sweep program at go.thread.bank/sweepdisclosure and a list of program banks at go.thread.bank/programbanks. Please contact customerservice@thread.bank with questions on the sweep program.‚Äù **Terms, conditions, and restrictions apply to earning cashback. Please see Cashback Rewards Program Terms & Conditions for more details. Atomic Invest LLC (‚ÄúAtomic‚Äù), through a clearing relationship with Pershing LLC (‚ÄúPershing‚Äù) offers a cash sweep program. Funds in transit to or from Program Banks are generally not FDIC-insured. The Sweep Program is administered by Pershing, LLC. Deposits at each Program Bank are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity. Based on eligibility criteria, the two FDIC-insured programs (‚ÄúBank Deposit Programs‚Äù) offered are 1) Dreyfus Insured Deposits (DIDI) and 2) Liquid Insured Deposits . Funds deposited into each sweep program, in aggregate, are eligible for up to $2,500,000 of FDIC insurance. The sweep programs can be configured so that once the funds reach one or more Program Banks (up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity at up to ten Program Banks), then the next Bank Deposit Program is initiated. Although certain types of accounts, such as trust accounts may be eligible for additional FDIC insurance based on the number of beneficiaries, funds will be allocated to each Program Bank in such a way that provides up to $250,000 of FDIC insurance for individual accounts and $250,000 of FDIC insurance for trust and other corporate account types, in each case per Program Bank. If clients elect to exclude one or more Program Banks from receiving deposits the amount of FDIC insurance available through the Atomic Invest account may be lower. Clients are responsible for monitoring their total assets at each Program Bank, including existing deposits held at Program Banks outside of the Atomic Invest account, to ensure FDIC insurance limits are not exceeded, which could result in some funds being uninsured. For more information on FDIC insurance please visit www.FDIC.gov. Deposits held in Program Banks are not protected by SIPC. For more information see Pershing‚Äôs Terms and Conditions and the Atomic Invest Form ADV Part 2A . Yield is an annualized 16-week T-bill rate when held to maturity as of 03/28/24. The rate shown is subject to price fluctuation and is net of fees. T-bills are purchased at a discount to par, $1,000, with the price being subject to market fluctuation. The amount of T-Bills available at a particular yield will depend upon the sellers‚Äô offer size; any remaining cash balance after the purchase may not earn this yield.

For Every customers with deposit accounts on Thread Bank, your deposits qualify for up to a maximum of $2,500,000 in FDIC insurance coverage when placed at program banks in the Thread Bank deposit sweep program. Your deposits at each program bank become eligible for FDIC insurance up to $250,000, inclusive of any other deposits you may already hold at the bank in the same ownership capacity. You can access the terms and conditions of the sweep program at go.thread.bank/sweepdisclosure and a list of program banks at go.thread.bank/programbanks. Please contact customerservice@thread.bank with questions on the sweep program.‚Äù **Terms, conditions, and restrictions apply to earning cashback. Please see Cashback Rewards Program Terms & Conditions for more details. Atomic Invest LLC (‚ÄúAtomic‚Äù), through a clearing relationship with Pershing LLC (‚ÄúPershing‚Äù) offers a cash sweep program. Funds in transit to or from Program Banks are generally not FDIC-insured. The Sweep Program is administered by Pershing, LLC. Deposits at each Program Bank are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity. Based on eligibility criteria, the two FDIC-insured programs (‚ÄúBank Deposit Programs‚Äù) offered are 1) Dreyfus Insured Deposits (DIDI) and 2) Liquid Insured Deposits . Funds deposited into each sweep program, in aggregate, are eligible for up to $2,500,000 of FDIC insurance. The sweep programs can be configured so that once the funds reach one or more Program Banks (up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity at up to ten Program Banks), then the next Bank Deposit Program is initiated. Although certain types of accounts, such as trust accounts may be eligible for additional FDIC insurance based on the number of beneficiaries, funds will be allocated to each Program Bank in such a way that provides up to $250,000 of FDIC insurance for individual accounts and $250,000 of FDIC insurance for trust and other corporate account types, in each case per Program Bank. If clients elect to exclude one or more Program Banks from receiving deposits the amount of FDIC insurance available through the Atomic Invest account may be lower. Clients are responsible for monitoring their total assets at each Program Bank, including existing deposits held at Program Banks outside of the Atomic Invest account, to ensure FDIC insurance limits are not exceeded, which could result in some funds being uninsured. For more information on FDIC insurance please visit www.FDIC.gov. Deposits held in Program Banks are not protected by SIPC. For more information see Pershing‚Äôs Terms and Conditions and the Atomic Invest Form ADV Part 2A . Yield is an annualized 16-week T-bill rate when held to maturity as of 03/28/24. The rate shown is subject to price fluctuation and is net of fees. T-bills are purchased at a discount to par, $1,000, with the price being subject to market fluctuation. The amount of T-Bills available at a particular yield will depend upon the sellers‚Äô offer size; any remaining cash balance after the purchase may not earn this yield. Every, Inc. has an engagement with Atomic Invest, LLC (‚ÄúAtomic Invest‚Äù), an SEC-registered investment adviser, to bring you the opportunity to open an investment advisory account. Investment advisory services are provided by Atomic Invest. Companies which are engaged by Atomic Invest receive compensation of 0% to 0.85% annualized, payable monthly, based upon assets under management for each referred client who establishes an account with Atomic Invest (i.e., exact payment will differ).

25314,Trellus,Real-time sales coach for SDRs ,"Trellus delivers simple coaching prompts to your salespeople in real time as they speak to prospects. Prompts are delivered in response to what is happening in a conversation. The goal of these prompts is to get more reps achieving quota and to reduce the time it takes to start attaining quota.

Prompts are action-oriented steps toward empathetic listening and effective discovery. Examples include 'pause' (when talking too much), 'set next steps' (when wrapping up a call without them), and 'ask current state' (when encountering objections).

Trellus is backed by Y Combinator and founded by former MIT researchers.",W22,Active,"['AI-Enhanced Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'SaaS', 'B2B', 'Sales']",New York,US,2022.0,2,"['Ajinkya Nene', 'Craig Bonnoit']",3.0,https://www.trellus.ai,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/trytrellus/about/,"AI Cold Call Coach | Trellus Auto Dialer About Packaging Blog Contact us Install Extension Book more meetings on your cold calls Trellus uses real-time analytics to provide sales reps with a personalized AI sales coach on each and every call.

Shawn Kipnis ADE @OpenText ""I absolutely cannot live without Trellus. The pace feature is great and tells you when to slow down. Other great benefits are it does research about your prospect now, it transcribes the whole conversation, and it helps with objections as well. Recently I booked a meeting but wrote down the prospects email address. I left my notebook at the office but with Trellus I knew I had the transcription of the call and that email! Disaster to go back to the office averted."" Keith Loh Founding SDR @Novata ""I‚Äôve been loving the new AI research feature of the tool that pulls up a summary of the prospect - specifically around what my ICP would invest in."" Emily Maguire RDR @Funnel ""Being passionate about our product can lead me to talk very quickly sometimes, so getting real-time alerts from Trellus to slow down helps me focus on key points and not overwhelm prospects. I've noticed over time that I am naturally speaking slower on cold calls ! Looking back at transcripts helps me also reflect on what I could have done differently in hindsight, and when I should change tactics."" Tamina Sabnani SDR @CleverTap ""I've never had proper cold call training so Trellus has helped me tremendously with being able to go back and review calls, by telling me when I'm speaking too quickly (something I do a lot), and with the real time voice transcripts that have saved me on numerous occasions where I didn't hear what the prospect said and got to read it instead of asking them to repeat themselves."" Alex Bensley SDR @Cognism ""Trellus allows me to read what the prospect is saying while they are saying it, which helps because sometimes it's hard for me to retain everything by listening alone. It even suggests questions to ask during the conversation! Also, I love the call reports Trellus sends back, providing me with the most common objections received, average cadence with prospect, and more. Seriously, Trellus is awesome "" Zacharias Lind Public Sector SDR @Snowflake ""Trellus adds value not just to me, but to my prospects as well. Instead of entering a call with poorly maintained Salesforce notes of our our previous conversations, Trellus gives me a summary of exactly what we talked about and how we left off. This has helped me deliver more personalized conversations that resonate with prospects."" Jasmine Agius ENT Solutions Consultant @Rubrik ""I love how it sets up a draft email for me I can just copy and paste! It is pretty accurate in scripting everything that's said so I don't really have to take notes, which saves a bunch of time. "" Zach Day Senior SDR @Relevize ‚ÄúI think for me the biggest value I've seen is the objection handling tips and the speaking pace indicator . I have the tendency to speak quickly when I'm on a call and having that indicator tell me to slow down and really articulate the message I'm trying to get across has been helpful. The objection handling tips are a great reminder of the types of coaching we all get from managers, but to have those tips pop up live on my screen as I'm having a conversation helps me sound relaxed and confident in overturning those objections.‚Äù 1 click install.

Tamina Sabnani SDR @CleverTap ""I've never had proper cold call training so Trellus has helped me tremendously with being able to go back and review calls, by telling me when I'm speaking too quickly (something I do a lot), and with the real time voice transcripts that have saved me on numerous occasions where I didn't hear what the prospect said and got to read it instead of asking them to repeat themselves."" Alex Bensley SDR @Cognism ""Trellus allows me to read what the prospect is saying while they are saying it, which helps because sometimes it's hard for me to retain everything by listening alone. It even suggests questions to ask during the conversation! Also, I love the call reports Trellus sends back, providing me with the most common objections received, average cadence with prospect, and more. Seriously, Trellus is awesome "" Zacharias Lind Public Sector SDR @Snowflake ""Trellus adds value not just to me, but to my prospects as well. Instead of entering a call with poorly maintained Salesforce notes of our our previous conversations, Trellus gives me a summary of exactly what we talked about and how we left off. This has helped me deliver more personalized conversations that resonate with prospects."" Jasmine Agius ENT Solutions Consultant @Rubrik ""I love how it sets up a draft email for me I can just copy and paste! It is pretty accurate in scripting everything that's said so I don't really have to take notes, which saves a bunch of time. "" Zach Day Senior SDR @Relevize ‚ÄúI think for me the biggest value I've seen is the objection handling tips and the speaking pace indicator . I have the tendency to speak quickly when I'm on a call and having that indicator tell me to slow down and really articulate the message I'm trying to get across has been helpful. The objection handling tips are a great reminder of the types of coaching we all get from managers, but to have those tips pop up live on my screen as I'm having a conversation helps me sound relaxed and confident in overturning those objections.‚Äù 1 click install.
