28183,Metal,Machine learning embeddings as a service,"Metal does machine learning embeddings as a service.  Embeddings are what AI models use to represent meaning. They capture the relationship between concepts, and they’re at the heart of every generative AI application, like ChatGPT and DALL-E.

As the data format of machine learning, embeddings are critical to every AI application. But there are no existing tools that help developers use them.

Metal is a fully managed service for developers to build applications with embeddings. We handle all of the infrastructure, provide out of the box operations, and simple APIs.
