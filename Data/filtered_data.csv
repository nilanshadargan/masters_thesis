Other great benefits are it does research about your prospect now, it transcribes the whole conversation, and it helps with objections as well. Recently I booked a meeting but wrote down the prospects email address. I left my notebook at the office but with Trellus I knew I had the transcription of the call and that email! Disaster to go back to the office averted."" Keith Loh Founding SDR @Novata ""I’ve been loving the new AI research feature of the tool that pulls up a summary of the prospect - specifically around what my ICP would invest in."" Emily Maguire RDR @Funnel ""Being passionate about our product can lead me to talk very quickly sometimes, so getting real-time alerts from Trellus to slow down helps me focus on key points and not overwhelm prospects. I've noticed over time that I am naturally speaking slower on cold calls ! Looking back at transcripts helps me also reflect on what I could have done differently in hindsight, and when I should change tactics."" Tamina Sabnani SDR @CleverTap ""I've never had proper cold call training so Trellus has helped me tremendously with being able to go back and review calls, by telling me when I'm speaking too quickly (something I do a lot), and with the real time voice transcripts that have saved me on numerous occasions where I didn't hear what the prospect said and got to read it instead of asking them to repeat themselves."" Alex Bensley SDR @Cognism ""Trellus allows me to read what the prospect is saying while they are saying it, which helps because sometimes it's hard for me to retain everything by listening alone. It even suggests questions to ask during the conversation! Also, I love the call reports Trellus sends back, providing me with the most common objections received, average cadence with prospect, and more. Seriously, Trellus is awesome "" Zacharias Lind Public Sector SDR @Snowflake ""Trellus adds value not just to me, but to my prospects as well. Instead of entering a call with poorly maintained Salesforce notes of our our previous conversations, Trellus gives me a summary of exactly what we talked about and how we left off. This has helped me deliver more personalized conversations that resonate with prospects."" Jasmine Agius ENT Solutions Consultant @Rubrik ""I love how it sets up a draft email for me I can just copy and paste! It is pretty accurate in scripting everything that's said so I don't really have to take notes, which saves a bunch of time. "" Zach Day Senior SDR @Relevize “I think for me the biggest value I've seen is the objection handling tips and the speaking pace indicator . I have the tendency to speak quickly when I'm on a call and having that indicator tell me to slow down and really articulate the message I'm trying to get across has been helpful. The objection handling tips are a great reminder of the types of coaching we all get from managers, but to have those tips pop up live on my screen as I'm having a conversation helps me sound relaxed and confident in overturning those objections.” 1 click install.

Kevin Wu Co-founder The analytics and insights I get from Kaya have been such a time saver, and helped cut through the chaff and show us the numbers that mattered and what they meant. It was very helpful in guiding us on what to focus on while scaling up our business. Shaun Low Founder Kaya has been helping us out with some marketing as well, and they have been AMAZING to work with. Highly recommend talking to them! Paul Nakata Founder/CEO When we signed up for Kaya I was expecting a little more insight on our Social Ad performance with a few dashboards. What we got was an extension of our team, linking data from various systems to create completely automated reports and dashboards that span the whole business. And no matter how challenging the request, the Kaya team always find a solution. Dave Lane Head of Growth Kaya grew our Google Ads conversions by 651%, decreased offer costs by 80%, and increased key conversion points +3x. By trusting Kaya and delegating, we regained time to spend understanding our users. Roland Mansilla Co-founder So glad you are building Kaya, guys!

Appropriately leveled books will be automatically loaded into the app for you! How does my child use Ello? Your child will simply log into the app and choose a book to start reading. If they need help with a word, they can tap on the word for help from Ello. How does Ello keep my child engaged? As your child reads, Ello brings the story to life, provides words of encouragement, and helps them if they get stuck so they don't get frustrated. We use behavioral psychology and a growth mindset paradigm to keep your child encouraged, help their confidence soar, and build a love of reading. Ello offers a reward system as well. In this system, children collect stars and badges, leading up to a completion prize that is either delivered digitally, included in the next box, or both! My child is reading the words wrong but Ello isn’t correcting them. What’s going on? Since children can get easily discouraged, Ello leans on the lenient side. We recommend sitting with your child when they read and helping with some of these corrections yourself. Is Ello good for kids with dyslexia? Ello’s instructional method was developed by reading specialists with backgrounds in dyslexia intervention and uses direct, explicit, and sequential phonics instruction. This is exactly what research shows works for helping children with dyslexia learn how to read.

Email support@helloello.com or text (415) 214 8119 What kind of books are in the app? We offer books that are level-appropriate, inclusive, and engaging. Where do your books come from? Our physical books are mostly favorite classics. We get them from publishers and you might even already own some of them. Our e-books in the Ello app come from a special team of authors who specialize in reading education. They are created with the science of reading in mind. What types of physical books do you send? Every box of books has to meet three criteria: ‍ Highly engaging Just the right level for your child’s reading ability Match common age-based interests ‍ We believe that fantastic books create enthusiastic readers and we work with reading specialists to source classic beloved books and new undiscovered gems. The best part is that we take the guesswork out of finding books that are ""just right"" for your child – ones that are not too easy and not too hard. How do you determine my child's reading level? We make it easy! We’ll take you through a short series of questions in our onboarding process. We use your answers to determine your child’s estimated reading level and reach out if we have any questions. As your child completes each level, they will automatically progress to more difficult books. If the books are ever too easy or hard, please let us know and we can help change their reading level.‍ What does it mean that a book is ‘just right’ for my child? ‍ If a child is reading on the appropriate level, they should make 1-10 mistakes per book. Any more than this and we find they get frustrated and overwhelmed. Less mistakes and we find they get bored and aren’t engaged. By answering a few short questions, we can help determine your child’s appropriate developmental reading level. We are also happy to set the reading level to whatever they are reading at school, as determined by their teacher. The books are too hard or too easy. How do I change the reading level for my child? No problem! We want each child to have the best experience possible. This means making sure they are reading on the right level for their abilities. Please email or text Customer Support and we will be happy to make any adjustments you may need. When I unlock new books, will we still be able to read the old ones? Yes! The books will stay available in the app so you can enjoy them over and over again. Other questions? Email support@helloello.com or text (415) 214 8119 What data do you collect?

Keeping up with work, volunteer, and personal life tasks has become a challenge, and I have been consistently dropping the ball. I have found that with Motion I am dropping that ball less and staying much more focused on what needs to be done, rather than trying to figure out what needs to be done. Vanessa G (Verified User on G2) The Happiness Algorithm I don’t usually write reviews. But Motion is revolutionary. The happiness algorithm they promote states it will help you: feel accomplished, get serious stuff done, and relax and sleep better. Check, check, and check. After week and half of use, I think my productivity is up 10x. js5993 Changed my life. Motion helps me be reasonable with my time. Before Motion, I was just go-go-go. Now, I realize how much I am putting on my plate and how unreasonable I'm being. Motion helps me prioritize my tasks and keep me on track. I use it everyday. Charlotte R (Verified User on G20) This app is a game changer I run a commercial commercial construction company and this app has been a game changer. As far as organization time management and project timelines it is phenomenal. This is probably the only application I use on a daily basis to help organize jobs tasks within jobs and my weekly schedule. mbxer Motion has been my best friend in overcoming executive dysfunction. I struggle greatly with procrastination and Motion has been instrumental in my academic and professional successes. Motion has taken the stress away from planning my daily workflow and it has helped me avoid many instances of execution paralysis. This has helped me enjoy my free time more, knowing that I will be able to get everything done on time.

Francis M (Verified User on G2) The current tool I'm in love with is @useMotion I used to work 60 hours per week and beat myself to the point of depression but now I work ~40 with same productivity Not only is it my literal personal assistant scheduling tasks for me, but it rearranges them when life happens @taayjus After a few days with @useMotion, I can see this becoming my go-to app I dumped all of my tasks into the app with some hard and soft deadlines and it managed to schedule my days beautifully. If things come up and I can't complete the task, it gets re-shuffled! @MarkPoppen Use it everyday Originally, I trialed Motion and a competing app. I decided to go with the competitor. But after several months, I had an epiphany of why Motion was better. It handled rescheduling in a much more automated and intuitive way! I switched back and I use it to plan everything.

Francis M (Verified User on G2) The current tool I'm in love with is @useMotion I used to work 60 hours per week and beat myself to the point of depression but now I work ~40 with same productivity Not only is it my literal personal assistant scheduling tasks for me, but it rearranges them when life happens @taayjus After a few days with @useMotion, I can see this becoming my go-to app I dumped all of my tasks into the app with some hard and soft deadlines and it managed to schedule my days beautifully. If things come up and I can't complete the task, it gets re-shuffled! @MarkPoppen Use it everyday Originally, I trialed Motion and a competing app. I decided to go with the competitor.

From autonomous vehicles to robot chefs, computer vision is changing the way that humans & machines collaborate in the real world. By automating repeatable tasks, computer vision enables outsized gains in human productivity. We are a team of machine perception & security experts applying leading-edge computer vision research to the needs of physical security organizations. We don’t do facial recognition. The privacy vs. security trade-off is a false dichotomy. You can respect individual privacy and increase group security. That’s why we don’t & won’t embrace facial recognition. We do always adapt to risk. Whether your immediate concern is everyday health and safety, employee tailgating, physical perimeter breaches or weapons detection, Ambient.ai has a threat signature. Ambient.ai threat signatures look for unexpected changes in human behavior. Behavior, combined with locations and location context, is used to identify emerging security incidents. With an expansive library of threat signatures, the Ambient.ai product is designed to adapt in real-time to an always changing risk landscape. Safety Falls & Medical Issues Resolution: Emergency services dispatched immediately. High Impact Alarm Reduction Resolution: Officers respond to AI-verified alerts — not false alarms Medium Impact Perimeter Breach Resolution: Apprehended by local police before damage done. High Impact Weapon detection Resolution: Life threatening situation averted. PRODUCT OVERVIEW Introducing Ambient.ai, the always-on brain for your physical security systems. We’re not just technologists, we are product designers, developers & security practitioners ourselves. We wanted to move our teams from reactive to proactive security, so we designed a product with near-human visual perception. For the last two years, this product has been driving improved security outcomes for Global 2000 companies, world-class museums, data centers, schools, warehouses, & other types of physical locations. Why Ambient.ai Proactive Risk Alerts Reduce false alarms in real-time Use patent pending, full scene video context to control alarms, filtering out the noisy 99% and orchestrating real-time dispatch for real incidents. Graph-Powered Forensics Increase the speed of forensics post-incident. Use the visual attributes of any object in an incident to efficiently search across locations and times to quickly review the video footage of what happened before and after the incident. Mobile Dispatch Dispatch security personnel with context. Empower responders by integrating video intelligence into your dispatches. Enable your team to see a video preview of the scene they’re walking into. Reduce false alarms 93%. Use patent pending, full scene video context to control alarms, filtering out the noisy 99% & orchestrating real-time dispatch for real incidents. Speed investigations by 90%. Use the visual attributes of objects to efficiently find every video moment where that object was present. Respond 10x faster. Empower responders by integrating video intelligence into your dispatches. Enable your team to see a video preview of the scene they’re walking into. Designed to empower, not overwhelm your team. Today our security is limited by human capacity to manually translate streaming video into actionable information. After 12 minutes of continuous video monitoring an operator will miss up to 45% of screen activity. After 22 min of continuous viewing, up to 95% of screen activity is overlooked. Human attention is a scarce commodity. Alert fatigue is real. And in threat scenarios, seconds count. Ambient.ai is designed to deliver a product experience differentiated by human-machine collaboration. Every interface & workflow is thoughtfully crafted to lower adoption barriers, engage users on a human level, & enable teams to perform at their best in high stress scenarios. our customers Trusted by Fortune 500 Companies Ambient’s efficiencies allow us to execute a broader range of security and risk management activities, rather than having our personnel locked down behind a mountain of manual tasks and alarm noise. Rod Pearson Director of Global Security, Impossible Foods We were able to detect fence jumping. If you have operators and they are monitoring cameras, a fence jump is going to take 30 seconds – they are not going to catch that. The only thing that can do that is an AI system. Ted Richie Director of Technical Operations, NorCal Cannabis What Ambient.ai gives us is the ability to see not only when someone is jumping a fence, but also what they were doing way before that, like when they were loitering with their car outside.

29157,Orbio Earth,Tracking methane emissions with satellites,"Orbio Earth has developed a software platform that uses satellites to monitor methane emissions from the energy industry. 
Mismanagement of methane emissions triggers stock devaluations, stranded assets and increases global warming. 
Operators and financial companies use Orbio Earth’s data and products to better manage and reduce methane emission risks across their global energy portfolios.

Our platform helps operators and financial analysts detect emissions before anybody else and prioritize reduction opportunities via best-in-class methane emissions measurements for every piece of oil & gas infrastructure on earth. 01 Real-Time Methane Monitoring Utilize real-time measurement data from satellites to inform existing methane management, reduction and compliance activities across site, asset, regions and company scales. 02 Asset-level risk benchmarking Compare methane targets with measurement-informed benchmarks across asset, region and company levels 03 Super-emission alerts and time-constraining Find out before third parties when there is an emission event in your portfolio, kick-off reduction activities and time-constrain the event with high-frequency detections before and after the detection who orbio is for Reducing portfolio emission risk for the energy and finance sectors Orbio Earth delivers tailored solutions to help energy companies monitor and reduce emission risks and investors navigate the complexities of portfolio emissions. ‍ Our advanced methane tracking technology is not just about detecting emissions, it's about enabling smarter decisions, ensuring compliance, and driving sustainable practices for both the companies on the ground and the firms investing in them. Credit & Equity Investors For investors asking how to invest into energy companies in the future. Orbio benchmarks existing energy portfolios on emission performance, and models related transitional risks. Oil & Gas Operators Orbio equips oil & gas operators with real-time data to pre-emptively address emission risks, ensuring compliance and safeguarding against regulatory repercussions. How Our Platform Works A three step journey to environmental clarity. Learn more OUR PLATFORM From Data to Insight Learn more about how we generate decision-useful data on energy portfolios from every existing public satellite in space. Stanford CASE STUDY How Orbio Earth creates market-leading emissions data with global, asset-level satellite imagery We’ve found ways to extract the methane signal from satellite data that allows us to scan every oil & gas facility in the globe every couple of days. Key to this has been ensuring our data is the highest quality, and our recent study with Stanford University was a validation of these efforts. The problem The Underreported Crisis of Methane Emissions Financial and energy sectors rely on generic emission calculation methods making it difficult to manage risks rising from methane regulation sweeping the globe. There are 12 million oil & gas facilities globally capable of emitting methane emissions, and a huge amount go under the radar. Traditional methods fall short in accurately reporting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, leading to a staggering underreporting of up to 70%. ‍ As the world braces for stringent regulations with significant financial repercussions, such as the impending IRA methane fee in the US and forthcoming EU regulation , the immediate need for precision in methane emission benchmarking has never been more critical. Our partners and collaborators Frequently asked questions How does the Orbio Earth platform work? Orbio utilises satellite data to capture images of methane every 4 days from any site on earth. We then reconcile this satellite emissions data with emission factor datasets to provide better emission benchmarks of assets, companies and supply chains . Why is understanding methane emissions important? Reducing man-made methane emissions are a win for both the climate and companies in the energy and financial sectors. Stopping these emissions from the energy industry alone could prevent 0.2°C of global warming. To put that into perspective, it would be like taking all cars and trucks off the road globally. Preventing these emissions are surprisingly simple when stakeholders are equipped with the right data. How is Orbio Earth different? Firstly Orbio can deliver data at high spatial resolutions meaning emissions can be attributed to specific assets . The main methane-specific satellite in use today gives regional scale resolutions making it very difficult to gauge where the source of methane emissions are coming from. Secondly, Orbio has begun reconciling emissions data with non-emission datasets to inform how existing reporting efforts and aid with risk identification . How can I get involved with Orbio Earth? We are open to any connections! Find us on Linkedin, Crunchbase and Twitter, or drop us a line on info@orbio.earth, we are always keen on talking to people who are interested in tackling the methane problem. Why are current methane emission estimates so inaccurate Because estimating methane emissions is very difficult! There are three main reasons for this: 1. The nature of events are quite random , it can be from a leaking valve to a maintenance event, to a blowout. 2. There are 12 million energy assets worldwide that can emit methane . Therefore it's difficult to capture accurate data about emissions across such large scales. 3. Lastly, the majority of methane emissions are un-reported events , therefore, usually, they are not taken into account by current estimates. What sort of business risks can methane emissions create There are three examples that can be pointed to here: ‍ 1. Regulatory Pressure is increasing - after CO26 and the Global methane pledge, which 100 countries signed, methane regulations are being introduced creating transitional risks for companies. This transitional risk and regulatory pressure is in turn leading to shareholders pressuring businesses to better account for methane in their supply chain. 2. Unaccounted methane emissions can lead to drops in company valuations. Diversified energy recently suffered a $300m drop in its share price after it was found to have higher methane emissions in its supply chain than reported. 3. Companies are backing out of purchasing decisions based on methane emission risk.

Credit & Equity Investors For investors asking how to invest into energy companies in the future. Orbio benchmarks existing energy portfolios on emission performance, and models related transitional risks. Oil & Gas Operators Orbio equips oil & gas operators with real-time data to pre-emptively address emission risks, ensuring compliance and safeguarding against regulatory repercussions. How Our Platform Works A three step journey to environmental clarity. Learn more OUR PLATFORM From Data to Insight Learn more about how we generate decision-useful data on energy portfolios from every existing public satellite in space. Stanford CASE STUDY How Orbio Earth creates market-leading emissions data with global, asset-level satellite imagery We’ve found ways to extract the methane signal from satellite data that allows us to scan every oil & gas facility in the globe every couple of days. Key to this has been ensuring our data is the highest quality, and our recent study with Stanford University was a validation of these efforts. The problem The Underreported Crisis of Methane Emissions Financial and energy sectors rely on generic emission calculation methods making it difficult to manage risks rising from methane regulation sweeping the globe. There are 12 million oil & gas facilities globally capable of emitting methane emissions, and a huge amount go under the radar. Traditional methods fall short in accurately reporting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, leading to a staggering underreporting of up to 70%. ‍ As the world braces for stringent regulations with significant financial repercussions, such as the impending IRA methane fee in the US and forthcoming EU regulation , the immediate need for precision in methane emission benchmarking has never been more critical. Our partners and collaborators Frequently asked questions How does the Orbio Earth platform work? Orbio utilises satellite data to capture images of methane every 4 days from any site on earth. We then reconcile this satellite emissions data with emission factor datasets to provide better emission benchmarks of assets, companies and supply chains . Why is understanding methane emissions important? Reducing man-made methane emissions are a win for both the climate and companies in the energy and financial sectors. Stopping these emissions from the energy industry alone could prevent 0.2°C of global warming. To put that into perspective, it would be like taking all cars and trucks off the road globally. Preventing these emissions are surprisingly simple when stakeholders are equipped with the right data. How is Orbio Earth different? Firstly Orbio can deliver data at high spatial resolutions meaning emissions can be attributed to specific assets . The main methane-specific satellite in use today gives regional scale resolutions making it very difficult to gauge where the source of methane emissions are coming from. Secondly, Orbio has begun reconciling emissions data with non-emission datasets to inform how existing reporting efforts and aid with risk identification . How can I get involved with Orbio Earth? We are open to any connections! Find us on Linkedin, Crunchbase and Twitter, or drop us a line on info@orbio.earth, we are always keen on talking to people who are interested in tackling the methane problem. Why are current methane emission estimates so inaccurate Because estimating methane emissions is very difficult! There are three main reasons for this: 1. The nature of events are quite random , it can be from a leaking valve to a maintenance event, to a blowout. 2. There are 12 million energy assets worldwide that can emit methane . Therefore it's difficult to capture accurate data about emissions across such large scales. 3. Lastly, the majority of methane emissions are un-reported events , therefore, usually, they are not taken into account by current estimates.

Funds in transit to or from Program Banks are generally not FDIC-insured. The Sweep Program is administered by Pershing, LLC. Deposits at each Program Bank are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity. Based on eligibility criteria, the two FDIC-insured programs (“Bank Deposit Programs”) offered are 1) Dreyfus Insured Deposits (DIDI) and 2) Liquid Insured Deposits . Funds deposited into each sweep program, in aggregate, are eligible for up to $2,500,000 of FDIC insurance. The sweep programs can be configured so that once the funds reach one or more Program Banks (up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity at up to ten Program Banks), then the next Bank Deposit Program is initiated. Although certain types of accounts, such as trust accounts may be eligible for additional FDIC insurance based on the number of beneficiaries, funds will be allocated to each Program Bank in such a way that provides up to $250,000 of FDIC insurance for individual accounts and $250,000 of FDIC insurance for trust and other corporate account types, in each case per Program Bank. If clients elect to exclude one or more Program Banks from receiving deposits the amount of FDIC insurance available through the Atomic Invest account may be lower. Clients are responsible for monitoring their total assets at each Program Bank, including existing deposits held at Program Banks outside of the Atomic Invest account, to ensure FDIC insurance limits are not exceeded, which could result in some funds being uninsured. For more information on FDIC insurance please visit www.FDIC.gov. Deposits held in Program Banks are not protected by SIPC. For more information see Pershing’s Terms and Conditions and the Atomic Invest Form ADV Part 2A . Yield is an annualized 16-week T-bill rate when held to maturity as of 03/28/24. The rate shown is subject to price fluctuation and is net of fees. T-bills are purchased at a discount to par, $1,000, with the price being subject to market fluctuation. The amount of T-Bills available at a particular yield will depend upon the sellers’ offer size; any remaining cash balance after the purchase may not earn this yield.

Humand brings us together. Leticia Fenoglio CEO & Co-founder of Rapanui/Franui Humand is part of a passing train. It's not just large, resourceful organizations that need to get on board; small ones need to do so as well. Nowadays, you either get on or you get left behind. There's a transformation on the horizon, and people are demanding that transformation. Alejandro Salvarezza HR Director - Swiss Medical Group We needed to have a versatile and dynamic intranet, where the collaborator could easily access through his cell phone to stay in touch with everyone inside the company.  With Humand we achieved that. Roberto Acosta HR Director - Farmashop I find the private social network interesting and I like the possibility that collaborators have to tell their stories. It fosters a more emotional bond between them.
Also, reaching 3,500 people at the same time and with the same information, it is something that adds a lot of value to our communication. Hernan Scotti HR Director - Dia Supermarkets We found in Humand a user-friendly HR platform that is easy to manage and very agile, as it makes room for continuous improvements and finding new solutions. Marcelo Melamed EVP of Human Resources - Cirion Technologies Humand was just what we were looking for to optimize and centralize processes, and internal communication. We highly value the willingness and ability of the Humand team to adapt to our particular needs and consider our suggestions for improvement, which translates into benefits. Aldo Fenoglio CEO - Rapanui Inside Humand, people share knowledge, ask questions, stay informed, recognize each other for good reasons, access important files, and complete surveys. All with a gamified experience. Mario Adaro Minister of the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza Humand improved the work environment and fostered relationships among colleagues. Gustavo Nadales Former HR Director - ArcelorMittal Acindar With Humand, I feel that my voice and opinion matter. Now I can share the progress of my work to inspire others and receive feedback from my colleagues. Jorge Maristany Internal Communication Analyst - ArcelorMittal I would recommend Humand because it is highly competitive compared to similar tools in the market. We have an HR platform with everything we need, and all the people in the company are connected in one channel at the same time. Teresa Jofre Fuentes Head of Internal Communications - Swiss Medical Group With Humand, we centralize all the digital experience of our company's personnel on one platform. Fernando Perez Corporate Communications Manager - ArcelorMittal Acindar One of the great advantages of Humand is that it allows you to have all HR management in one place.

25314,Trellus,Real-time sales coach for SDRs ,"Trellus delivers simple coaching prompts to your salespeople in real time as they speak to prospects. Prompts are delivered in response to what is happening in a conversation. The goal of these prompts is to get more reps achieving quota and to reduce the time it takes to start attaining quota.

Prompts are action-oriented steps toward empathetic listening and effective discovery. Examples include 'pause' (when talking too much), 'set next steps' (when wrapping up a call without them), and 'ask current state' (when encountering objections).

Trellus is backed by Y Combinator and founded by former MIT researchers.",W22,Active,"['AI-Enhanced Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'SaaS', 'B2B', 'Sales']",New York,US,2022.0,2,"['Ajinkya Nene', 'Craig Bonnoit']",3.0,https://www.trellus.ai,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/trytrellus/about/,"AI Cold Call Coach | Trellus Auto Dialer About Packaging Blog Contact us Install Extension Book more meetings on your cold calls Trellus uses real-time analytics to provide sales reps with a personalized AI sales coach on each and every call.

Appropriately leveled books will be automatically loaded into the app for you! How does my child use Ello? Your child will simply log into the app and choose a book to start reading. If they need help with a word, they can tap on the word for help from Ello. How does Ello keep my child engaged? As your child reads, Ello brings the story to life, provides words of encouragement, and helps them if they get stuck so they don't get frustrated. We use behavioral psychology and a growth mindset paradigm to keep your child encouraged, help their confidence soar, and build a love of reading. Ello offers a reward system as well. In this system, children collect stars and badges, leading up to a completion prize that is either delivered digitally, included in the next box, or both!

Email support@helloello.com or text (415) 214 8119 What kind of books are in the app? We offer books that are level-appropriate, inclusive, and engaging. Where do your books come from? Our physical books are mostly favorite classics. We get them from publishers and you might even already own some of them. Our e-books in the Ello app come from a special team of authors who specialize in reading education. They are created with the science of reading in mind. What types of physical books do you send? Every box of books has to meet three criteria: ‍ Highly engaging Just the right level for your child’s reading ability Match common age-based interests ‍ We believe that fantastic books create enthusiastic readers and we work with reading specialists to source classic beloved books and new undiscovered gems. The best part is that we take the guesswork out of finding books that are ""just right"" for your child – ones that are not too easy and not too hard. How do you determine my child's reading level? We make it easy! We’ll take you through a short series of questions in our onboarding process. We use your answers to determine your child’s estimated reading level and reach out if we have any questions. As your child completes each level, they will automatically progress to more difficult books. If the books are ever too easy or hard, please let us know and we can help change their reading level.‍ What does it mean that a book is ‘just right’ for my child? ‍ If a child is reading on the appropriate level, they should make 1-10 mistakes per book. Any more than this and we find they get frustrated and overwhelmed. Less mistakes and we find they get bored and aren’t engaged. By answering a few short questions, we can help determine your child’s appropriate developmental reading level. We are also happy to set the reading level to whatever they are reading at school, as determined by their teacher. The books are too hard or too easy. How do I change the reading level for my child? No problem! We want each child to have the best experience possible. This means making sure they are reading on the right level for their abilities. Please email or text Customer Support and we will be happy to make any adjustments you may need. When I unlock new books, will we still be able to read the old ones? Yes! The books will stay available in the app so you can enjoy them over and over again. Other questions? Email support@helloello.com or text (415) 214 8119 What data do you collect?

The happiness algorithm they promote states it will help you: feel accomplished, get serious stuff done, and relax and sleep better. Check, check, and check. After week and half of use, I think my productivity is up 10x. js5993 Changed my life. Motion helps me be reasonable with my time. Before Motion, I was just go-go-go. Now, I realize how much I am putting on my plate and how unreasonable I'm being. Motion helps me prioritize my tasks and keep me on track. I use it everyday.

As far as organization time management and project timelines it is phenomenal. This is probably the only application I use on a daily basis to help organize jobs tasks within jobs and my weekly schedule. mbxer Motion has been my best friend in overcoming executive dysfunction. I struggle greatly with procrastination and Motion has been instrumental in my academic and professional successes. Motion has taken the stress away from planning my daily workflow and it has helped me avoid many instances of execution paralysis.

Francis M (Verified User on G2) The current tool I'm in love with is @useMotion I used to work 60 hours per week and beat myself to the point of depression but now I work ~40 with same productivity Not only is it my literal personal assistant scheduling tasks for me, but it rearranges them when life happens @taayjus After a few days with @useMotion, I can see this becoming my go-to app I dumped all of my tasks into the app with some hard and soft deadlines and it managed to schedule my days beautifully. If things come up and I can't complete the task, it gets re-shuffled! @MarkPoppen Use it everyday Originally, I trialed Motion and a competing app. I decided to go with the competitor. But after several months, I had an epiphany of why Motion was better. It handled rescheduling in a much more automated and intuitive way! I switched back and I use it to plan everything.

Keeping up with work, volunteer, and personal life tasks has become a challenge, and I have been consistently dropping the ball. I have found that with Motion I am dropping that ball less and staying much more focused on what needs to be done, rather than trying to figure out what needs to be done. Vanessa G (Verified User on G2) The Happiness Algorithm I don’t usually write reviews. But Motion is revolutionary. The happiness algorithm they promote states it will help you: feel accomplished, get serious stuff done, and relax and sleep better. Check, check, and check. After week and half of use, I think my productivity is up 10x. js5993 Changed my life. Motion helps me be reasonable with my time. Before Motion, I was just go-go-go. Now, I realize how much I am putting on my plate and how unreasonable I'm being. Motion helps me prioritize my tasks and keep me on track. I use it everyday. Charlotte R (Verified User on G20) This app is a game changer I run a commercial commercial construction company and this app has been a game changer. As far as organization time management and project timelines it is phenomenal. This is probably the only application I use on a daily basis to help organize jobs tasks within jobs and my weekly schedule. mbxer Motion has been my best friend in overcoming executive dysfunction. I struggle greatly with procrastination and Motion has been instrumental in my academic and professional successes. Motion has taken the stress away from planning my daily workflow and it has helped me avoid many instances of execution paralysis. This has helped me enjoy my free time more, knowing that I will be able to get everything done on time. Kate B (Verified User on G2) Motion: The app that helps me manage my ADHD As someone­ with ADHD who struggles to stay focused and organized, I found gre­at joy in discovering the Motion app. This invaluable tool has be­come a lifeline, allowing me to effectively manage­ projects, priorities, and schedule­s — while accommodating my ADHD brain. Francis M (Verified User on G2) The current tool I'm in love with is @useMotion I used to work 60 hours per week and beat myself to the point of depression but now I work ~40 with same productivity Not only is it my literal personal assistant scheduling tasks for me, but it rearranges them when life happens @taayjus After a few days with @useMotion, I can see this becoming my go-to app I dumped all of my tasks into the app with some hard and soft deadlines and it managed to schedule my days beautifully. If things come up and I can't complete the task, it gets re-shuffled! @MarkPoppen Use it everyday Originally, I trialed Motion and a competing app. I decided to go with the competitor. But after several months, I had an epiphany of why Motion was better. It handled rescheduling in a much more automated and intuitive way! I switched back and I use it to plan everything.

So we needed a project management tool with a good mobile app that was easy to use too. We’ve been using Motion for a few months now, and it’s great.” Simba Chang Manager at ANANA Properties Switching to Motion was completely worth it. “We were using 15 different tools for tasks, and it was total chaos.

Motion saves our company hours each week, and helps us focus on the right tasks and projects.” Cal Hamilton Vice President at ForSitePro We’re finally finishing important projects! “We would never see projects come to fruition.

This technology has high test retest reliability and can be applied to any clinical grade MRI which is a very useful clinical tool to assist doctors advising patients with early memory complaints. In addition the BrainSee degeneration maps clearly show focal areas of degeneration. I believe this will be a widely used technology to assist doctors and patients navigating 
the difficult terrain of MCI.” Dr. Jamshid Ghajar MD, PhD, FACS “I am the PI of a longitudinal Brain Aging Study at HMRI for more than ten years. Our goal is to identify prodromal biomarkers and potential mechanisms of early dementia pathology of the Alzheimer type. Objective measures such as Darmiyan’s BrainSee that can predict cognitive decline are strongly needed to recognize and monitor potential therapies. I have interacted with Darmiyan for over two years, sharing some of the data from our Brain Aging study participants. I am excited by the potential for objective ways such as Darmiyan’s approach to predict cognitive decline, which can lead to better outcomes for patients and the healthcare system.” Dr. Michael G. Harrington MB, ChB, FRCP “As a member of the research team that evaluated Darmiyan’s solution for predicting conversion of cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s dementia, I was impressed by the potential of this breakthrough technology. All study investigators are optimistic that the solution will be successful providing a much needed predictor of disease progression.

In addition the BrainSee degeneration maps clearly show focal areas of degeneration. I believe this will be a widely used technology to assist doctors and patients navigating 
the difficult terrain of MCI.” Dr. Jamshid Ghajar MD, PhD, FACS “I am the PI of a longitudinal Brain Aging Study at HMRI for more than ten years. Our goal is to identify prodromal biomarkers and potential mechanisms of early dementia pathology of the Alzheimer type. Objective measures such as Darmiyan’s BrainSee that can predict cognitive decline are strongly needed to recognize and monitor potential therapies. I have interacted with Darmiyan for over two years, sharing some of the data from our Brain Aging study participants. I am excited by the potential for objective ways such as Darmiyan’s approach to predict cognitive decline, which can lead to better outcomes for patients and the healthcare system.” Dr. Michael G. Harrington MB, ChB, FRCP “As a member of the research team that evaluated Darmiyan’s solution for predicting conversion of cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s dementia, I was impressed by the potential of this breakthrough technology.

1487,Ambient.ai,AI company transforming enterprise physical security to prevent…,"Ambient.ai is a computer vision intelligence company transforming enterprise security operations to prevent security incidents before they happen. The Ambient.ai platform applies AI and computer vision intelligence to existing sensor and camera infrastructure to deliver continuous physical security monitoring and automate the immediate dispatch of human resources. Ambient.ai is the first platform that goes beyond basic motion detection and image recognition to achieve near-human perception with automated situational context. 

With physical security incidents on the rise and physical security organizations left under-resourced, Ambient.ai’s computer intelligence platform comes at a time of critical need, which is why the company has raised over $50 million from venture capital investors led by a16z. Today, large enterprises, schools and organizations – including many of the largest US tech companies and other Fortune 500 companies – use Ambient.ai to secure property, people, and assets from the most harrowing physical security threats.

The company was founded in 2017 by experts in artificial intelligence from Stanford who previously built iconic products at Apple, Google, Microsoft and Dropbox. We are backed by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), SV Angel, Y Combinator, and visionary angels like Jyoti Bansal, Mark Leslie and Elad Gil.",W17,Active,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Vision', 'Security']","San Jose, CA",US,2017.0,2,"['Shikhar Shrestha', 'Vikesh Khanna']",95.0,https://ambient.ai,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ambient-ai,https://www.linkedin.com/company/ambient-ai/?viewAsMember=true,"Ambient Ai Product 24/7 Proactive Threat Monitoring PACS Alarm Reduction AI-Powered Investigations Gun Detection Occupancy Insights Solutions Education Manufacturing Resources Events About We’re Hiring!
