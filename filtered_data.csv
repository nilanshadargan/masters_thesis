Auto fill properties and generate subtasks are a massive boon. I look forward to using Dart more! Sijia Qiu Analytics Consultant I've tried dozens of task management apps, and Dart is by far my favorite. You can run every feature via keyboard shortcuts, deeply customize your layout, and easily separate work and personal tasks. ‚Äç We use Dart for both team and personal tasks, and it ties with Slack as our most-frequently used app. David Paffenholz CEO & Co-Founder Dart's made it really easy to organize and manage tasks while capturing context. It's naturally integrated into our workflows and has really helped with productivity. We used to use iNotes/OneNote but Dart‚Äôs speed, shortcuts, and intuitive flow had us using it daily within a week of onboarding. Atyab Bhatti CEO & Cofounder I've witnessed firsthand the transformative impact of Dart's task management tool on our organization. Its integration of generative AI has been a game-changer, significantly boosting my team's productivity by streamlining administrative tasks. Dart's continuous evolution excites me, and I highly recommend it to any organization seeking to minimize administrative overhead while maintaining detailed task tracking, including durations, dependencies, and resource allocation. Chris Howe CEO As someone who has worked on multiple projects with distributed teams, I understand the challenges of project management. It's great to hear that Dart was designed to make this process easier for teams through its innovative use of AI. Ashley Smith Graphic Designer Dart has been an impressive project management tool, offering a seamless and beautiful experience that fits perfectly for various needs. Its user-friendly design and efficient document handling make it a pleasure to use, prompting me to transition all my work onto it. ‚Äç The tool's excellence has led me to recommend it to many friends, affirming its suitability and effectiveness for a wide range of use cases. ‚Äç Tejas Ewing Screenwriter Dart is 10x faster and cleaner than any other way we've found to track our work. Dart has been super quick-to-setup and incredibly fast for us to use. Other task managers had too much of overhead. Craig Bonnoit CTO THANK YOU!!! The chatgpt integration is amazing. I gave it enough context and prompting that it generated for me the exact daily plan for the next 90 days of building my startup MVP (with scary accuracy), and then Dart just created all the tasks for me. Thank you for this amazing and time saving capability. ‚Äç This just saved me probably an entire weeks worth of headache and trying to get my self organized let alone actually get the work done.

25314,Trellus,Real-time sales coach for SDRs ,"Trellus delivers simple coaching prompts to your salespeople in real time as they speak to prospects. Prompts are delivered in response to what is happening in a conversation. The goal of these prompts is to get more reps achieving quota and to reduce the time it takes to start attaining quota.

Prompts are action-oriented steps toward empathetic listening and effective discovery. Examples include 'pause' (when talking too much), 'set next steps' (when wrapping up a call without them), and 'ask current state' (when encountering objections).

Trellus is backed by Y Combinator and founded by former MIT researchers.",W22,Active,"['AI-Enhanced Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'SaaS', 'B2B', 'Sales']",New York,US,2022.0,2,"['Ajinkya Nene', 'Craig Bonnoit']",3.0,https://www.trellus.ai,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/trytrellus/about/,"AI Cold Call Coach | Trellus Auto Dialer About Packaging Blog Contact us Install Extension Book more meetings on your cold calls Trellus uses real-time analytics to provide sales reps with a personalized AI sales coach on each and every call. Install Extension or Book a Demo Works with Loved by reps at #1 trusted call coach for all XDRs Trellus is loved by reps at over 100+ sales organizations and this is why! Ethan Rausenberger Enterprise BDR @Contentful ""Since Trellus, I go into calls knowing I won't get stuck without a question to ask, without something to check my pace, and without knowing what my prospect *means* on the other end. I can feel comfortable Trellus will reliably capture insights for me and my team so we can improve our skills and comfortably tackle our prospect's next touch."" Shawn Kipnis ADE @OpenText ""I absolutely cannot live without Trellus. The pace feature is great and tells you when to slow down. Other great benefits are it does research about your prospect now, it transcribes the whole conversation, and it helps with objections as well. Recently I booked a meeting but wrote down the prospects email address. I left my notebook at the office but with Trellus I knew I had the transcription of the call and that email! Disaster to go back to the office averted."" Keith Loh Founding SDR @Novata ""I‚Äôve been loving the new AI research feature of the tool that pulls up a summary of the prospect - specifically around what my ICP would invest in."" Emily Maguire RDR @Funnel ""Being passionate about our product can lead me to talk very quickly sometimes, so getting real-time alerts from Trellus to slow down helps me focus on key points and not overwhelm prospects. I've noticed over time that I am naturally speaking slower on cold calls ! Looking back at transcripts helps me also reflect on what I could have done differently in hindsight, and when I should change tactics."" Tamina Sabnani SDR @CleverTap ""I've never had proper cold call training so Trellus has helped me tremendously with being able to go back and review calls, by telling me when I'm speaking too quickly (something I do a lot), and with the real time voice transcripts that have saved me on numerous occasions where I didn't hear what the prospect said and got to read it instead of asking them to repeat themselves."" Alex Bensley SDR @Cognism ""Trellus allows me to read what the prospect is saying while they are saying it, which helps because sometimes it's hard for me to retain everything by listening alone. It even suggests questions to ask during the conversation! Also, I love the call reports Trellus sends back, providing me with the most common objections received, average cadence with prospect, and more. Seriously, Trellus is awesome "" Zacharias Lind Public Sector SDR @Snowflake ""Trellus adds value not just to me, but to my prospects as well. Instead of entering a call with poorly maintained Salesforce notes of our our previous conversations, Trellus gives me a summary of exactly what we talked about and how we left off. This has helped me deliver more personalized conversations that resonate with prospects."" Jasmine Agius ENT Solutions Consultant @Rubrik ""I love how it sets up a draft email for me I can just copy and paste! It is pretty accurate in scripting everything that's said so I don't really have to take notes, which saves a bunch of time. "" Zach Day Senior SDR @Relevize ‚ÄúI think for me the biggest value I've seen is the objection handling tips and the speaking pace indicator . I have the tendency to speak quickly when I'm on a call and having that indicator tell me to slow down and really articulate the message I'm trying to get across has been helpful. The objection handling tips are a great reminder of the types of coaching we all get from managers, but to have those tips pop up live on my screen as I'm having a conversation helps me sound relaxed and confident in overturning those objections.‚Äù 1 click install.

24615,Synth,Second brain for knowledge workers,"We are building a second brain for knowledge workers. Our app captures all the relevant information you consume - text, audio, video and summarizes it 1-click. It also makes it easy to search and retrieve the information you want, wherever you like.

All co-founders know each other since 2019 and met at a one-year AI fellowship. Since their time at the fellowship, they have felt frustrated creating their second brain while shifting between apps like Roam Research, and Obsidian. These applications were burdening them to do all three tasks of capturing, organizing, and retrieving, making the cost to value ratio of setting up the second brain really high. They decided to solve this and want to shift the burden of these steps on to software, making it easier for a user to build their second brain.

MindPortal has been featured in: Our  Team & Collaborators hail from: WINNER OF IMPACT 2023: Innovation of the Year Award Our mission is to enable
seamless telepathic
communication between
humans and AI. Revolutionising Human-AI Interactions. At MindPortal, we‚Äôre shaping the future of human-AI communication. No more typing, clicking, or speaking. Simply think. Our cutting-edge technology enables humans to communicate with AI using thoughts, pioneering a world where telepathic communication with AI via neural interfaces are the norm. Neural Interface Definition: A neural interface, also known as a brain-computer interface, empowers direct communication between the human mind and external digital platforms. With MindPortal‚Äôs groundbreaking, non-invasive technology, we‚Äôre pioneering the future of human-AI telepathic communication. The AI Communication Challenge. As AI evolves, becoming more sophisticated and inching closer to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), our methods of interaction must keep pace. Using slow, cumbersome communication tools (like typing) with such advanced systems would be akin to trying to navigate a spaceship using bicycle handles. Depth, nuance, and full fidelity in conveying our ideas become paramount. A constrained communication channel inevitably hampers the full spectrum of benefits we might draw from these systems. ""Difficulty getting your thoughts across will soon cease to exist."" Ekram Alam, Co-founder & CEO at MindPortal MindPortal is pioneering a non-surgical wearable which enables telepathic communication between humans and AI. [Images shown are a rendering of a potential future design]. Telepathic Communication
with AI Through Advanced
Neural Interfaces. MindPortal develops state-of-the-art, non-invasive neural interfaces which bypass traditional speech and text inputs, connecting directly to the very fabric of human cognition. Our neural interface is designed to allow users to engage with AI with real-time thought. The result? A bitrate of information transfer which renders traditional methods obsolete. MindPortal has developed a successful proof of concept device which facilitates thought-to-text dialogues with leading-edge AI platforms like ChatGPT. The user thinks in sentences and their imagined speech is telepathically relayed to the AI. While ‚Äúbrain-machine interfaces‚Äù often evoke visions of invasive measures, MindPortal‚Äôs technology is being built with human anatomy, personal privacy and safety in mind. Leveraging the brain‚Äôs topographical evolution, we extract necessary information from surface layers, eliminating the need for invasive procedures. This ensures our approach is not only revolutionary but also accessible. Our Philosophy 1 We are optimistic about the future of AI and the development of artificial general intelligence. 2 We believe that technology has the ability to expand human capabilities and potential. 3 We believe that a future where humans and AI work symbiotically has the potential to herald a golden era which benefits humanity. 4 We think that by improving the bandwidth between humans and AI e.g. through human-AI telepathic communication, we can expand the potential of this symbiotic relationship. 5 By doing so, we think that humanity will advance towards a future of ever expanding possibilities and abundance.

For any other questions or concerns: Send an email to support@pragmaticleaders.io 16. Legal Disputes Most disputes can be easily resolved by communication, so before bringing a formal legal case, please first follow the Support matrix mentioned in the above section. If that doesn‚Äôt work and you live in the United States or Canada, your options are to go to small claims court or bring a claim in binding arbitration; you may not bring that claim in another court or participate in a non-individual class action claim against us. This Dispute Resolution section applies only if you live in the United States or Canada. a. Small Claims Either of us can bring a claim in small claims court in (a) San Francisco, California, (b) the county where you live, or (c) another place we both agree on, as long as it qualifies to be brought in that court. b. Going to Arbitration If we can‚Äôt resolve our dispute amicably, you and Truemerit agree to resolve any claims related to these Terms through final and binding arbitration, regardless of the type of claim or legal theory. If one of us brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated and the other party refuses to arbitrate it, the other party can ask a court to force us both to go to arbitration (compel arbitration). Either of us can also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing. c. The Arbitration Process Any disputes that involve a claim of less than $10,000 USD must be resolved exclusively through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. A party electing arbitration must initiate proceedings by filing an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer-Related Disputes. You and we agree that the following rules will apply to the proceedings: (a) the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions (at the choice of the party seeking relief); (b) the arbitration must not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses (unless we and you agree otherwise); and (c) any judgment on the arbitrator‚Äôs rendered award may be entered in any court with competent jurisdiction. Disputes that involve a claim of more than $10,000 USD must be resolved per the AAA‚Äôs rules about whether the arbitration hearing has to be in-person. d. No Class Actions We both agree that we can each only bring claims against the other on an individual basis. This means: (a) neither of us can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action; (b) an arbitrator can‚Äôt combine multiple people‚Äôs claims into a single case (or preside over any consolidated, class, or representative action); and (c) an arbitrator‚Äôs decision or award in one person‚Äôs case can only impact that user, not other users, and can‚Äôt be used to decide other users‚Äô disputes. If a court decides that this ‚ÄúNo class actions‚Äù clause isn‚Äôt enforceable or valid, then this ‚ÄúDispute Resolution‚Äù section will be null and void, but the rest of the Terms will still apply. 17. Electronic Communication Policy Truemerit is required to provide you with certain information in writing. This Electronic Communications Policy describes how we‚Äôll provide that information to you.

In order for Truemerit to send you paper copies, you must have a current mailing address on file in your Truemeritaccount.

Jeffrey Siaw VP of Data Science ... we know we can do that (annotate 100 hours of videos in four months) with Encord because of the whole process that we have, which compared to what we had before, it would be one procedure every two months even, much slower. Margaux Masson-Forsythe Director of Machine Learning Before, using clinicians to annotate precancerous polyp videos had prohibitively high costs because of the large number of datasets needed to train the model.

Vote B FAQs What is an AI text generator, exactly? An AI text generator is a software tool that helps you create content like blog articles, product descriptions and marketing copy. You provide Hypotenuse AI with some context such as product feature, or a topic to write about, and the AI software will take that to write a piece of content for you. It's like having an assistant who can respond to you instantly. Some people might be hesitant to try an AI writing assistant because they're unsure of its legitimacy, or afraid of plagiarism issues. Not to worry‚Äîeach piece of AI¬†copy and writing is written from scratch each time. With a free trial available, why not try it out for yourself to verify that? We've had great feedback from users who have seen a 38% increase in website traffic and engagement metrics. ‚Äç How does an AI text generator work? Our AI text generator works by first determining the type of content you'd like to create. It then analyzes and extracts the important factors based on your input. Once it understands the topic and tone you‚Äôre aiming for, it'll get to work writing a high-quality, unique article, product description or ad copy for you. You‚Äôll be able to review and edit the generated text as you see fit, before it‚Äôs published on your site or blog. The content you get will always be unique as the AI¬†text generator has a large range of vocabulary and deep understanding of sentence structures. To learn more, you can read our deep dive into AI¬†copywriting . What can an AI writing generator do for me? You can use our AI writing generator for a variety of purposes, including blog posts, website articles, social media posts, and more. These include: Article titles Article outlines Article introductions Article conclusions Article body paragraphs Product descriptions in various styles Google ad copy Instagram captions Image to Instagram captions Facebook ad copy Website headlines SEO Outlines More types of AI¬†writing are constantly being added, so let us know if there's anything that you'd like to see. Will content writing be fully automated by AI writing generator? Short answer: In the short term, no. Long answer: Our AI writing tool isn't a fully automated solution just yet, and human oversight and editing will always be necessary for quality content. You can expect to have a lot of control over the final product, so you can be sure that your voice and tone come through loud and clear. We often get the question: Can AI¬†text generators ever replace content writers? We believe that copywriting is both art and science, so nope‚Äîthere's no replacing the human touch. However, our AI text generator can help brainstorm alongside you and give you a first draft curated for your target audience. You can then spend more time on what you're best at: bringing your own special insight into great content. How much does an AI writing assistant cost? You can expect to pay a monthly subscription fee for an AI writing assistant‚Äîthis fee depends on the volume of content you generate and any additional features you need. ‚Äç Our pricing starts from $29/month with no minimum lock in. If you‚Äôre looking to build custom templates or AI models trained on your company‚Äôs brand voice, you should consider our Enterprise plans. ‚Äç Can AI writing ever be free? It costs money to get the AI writer to analyze and generate text (called an 'inference' in machine-learning terms), so unlike other software tools, it's unlikely that AI¬†text generation will ever become free. What languages do you support with AI writing? Hypotenuse currently supports: English (UK, US & Canadian), Bulgarian, Chinese (Simplified &¬†Traditional), Czech Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French (French &¬†Canadian), German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Portugese & Brazilian), Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish (Spanish &¬†Latin¬†America), Swedish, Tagalog¬†(Filipino), Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Ukranian.

Ello is a revolutionary state-of-the-art interactive reading buddy who listens to your child read out loud. Ello provides support when your child needs help reading, gentle corrections when they make errors, and motivation to keep your child engaged. Appropriately leveled books will be automatically loaded into the app for you! How does my child use Ello? Your child will simply log into the app and choose a book to start reading. If they need help with a word, they can tap on the word for help from Ello. How does Ello keep my child engaged? As your child reads, Ello brings the story to life, provides words of encouragement, and helps them if they get stuck so they don't get frustrated. We use behavioral psychology and a growth mindset paradigm to keep your child encouraged, help their confidence soar, and build a love of reading. Ello offers a reward system as well. In this system, children collect stars and badges, leading up to a completion prize that is either delivered digitally, included in the next box, or both! My child is reading the words wrong but Ello isn‚Äôt correcting them. What‚Äôs going on? Since children can get easily discouraged, Ello leans on the lenient side. We recommend sitting with your child when they read and helping with some of these corrections yourself. Is Ello good for kids with dyslexia?

Email support@helloello.com or text (415) 214 8119 What kind of books are in the app? We offer books that are level-appropriate, inclusive, and engaging. Where do your books come from? Our physical books are mostly favorite classics. We get them from publishers and you might even already own some of them. Our e-books in the Ello app come from a special team of authors who specialize in reading education. They are created with the science of reading in mind. What types of physical books do you send? Every box of books has to meet three criteria: ‚Äç Highly engaging Just the right level for your child‚Äôs reading ability Match common age-based interests ‚Äç We believe that fantastic books create enthusiastic readers and we work with reading specialists to source classic beloved books and new undiscovered gems. The best part is that we take the guesswork out of finding books that are ""just right"" for your child ‚Äì ones that are not too easy and not too hard. How do you determine my child's reading level? We make it easy! We‚Äôll take you through a short series of questions in our onboarding process. We use your answers to determine your child‚Äôs estimated reading level and reach out if we have any questions. As your child completes each level, they will automatically progress to more difficult books. If the books are ever too easy or hard, please let us know and we can help change their reading level.‚Äç What does it mean that a book is ‚Äòjust right‚Äô for my child? ‚Äç If a child is reading on the appropriate level, they should make 1-10 mistakes per book. Any more than this and we find they get frustrated and overwhelmed. Less mistakes and we find they get bored and aren‚Äôt engaged. By answering a few short questions, we can help determine your child‚Äôs appropriate developmental reading level. We are also happy to set the reading level to whatever they are reading at school, as determined by their teacher. The books are too hard or too easy. How do I change the reading level for my child? No problem! We want each child to have the best experience possible. This means making sure they are reading on the right level for their abilities. Please email or text Customer Support and we will be happy to make any adjustments you may need. When I unlock new books, will we still be able to read the old ones? Yes! The books will stay available in the app so you can enjoy them over and over again. Other questions? Email support@helloello.com or text (415) 214 8119 What data do you collect? If you choose to allow it, we process the audio of your child reading so that Ello can provide real-time support and motivation, and so your child can access certain features of the app, such as listening to themselves read. Separately, you can opt-in to give us access to this data so that we can improve Ello. ‚Äç We also collect data of your child's progress to provide the service (for example the rewards). ‚Äç Finally, we collect anonymous and aggregated usage data. See our privacy policy for full details. What do you do with the data you collect? It is up to you on what data we collect - it is optional. You will be asked if you would like to opt-in to data collection after downloading the app. ‚Äç All data is anonymous and aggregated and used to improve the product. Do you sell the data that you collect? No. Never. Do you have ads in the app? No. Never. How secure is the data you collect? It's very secure. We use industry-leading encryption and security. Other questions? Email support@helloello.com or text (415) 214 8119 When does the box ship? In most cases, your first Ello box will ship the business day after your order or monthly renewal.

We develop novel, next-generation, immunomodulatory therapies for rare & inflammatory diseases with no effective treatments. Our team is supercharging the drug development cycle by applying AI to multiple-mechanism-of-action protein targets and their natural platform capabilities‚Äîcreating novel therapeutics at an unprecedented pace. Our AI platform has enabled us to develop a purpose-built therapy for ARDS to reduce its $20 billion cost on society (just in the USA). 
 
GEn1E has built a rich pipeline of 21+ novel and selective immunomodulators and has plans to accelerate 2 additional devastating diseases (beyond their lead indication) to IND in the next 12 months. Our AI platform enables tremendous pace and capital efficiency as demonstrated by our progress in ~2 years with seed capital‚Äîa stark contrast to the typical spend of $100M+ and 7+ years exhibited in the pharmaceuticals / biotech industry.
 
With ~90% of rare diseases having no therapeutic treatment at all, GEn1E is taking a giant swing that will hopefully bring life-saving therapies to the lives of patients in need.

Previous attempts to address this dysregulation involved kinase inhibitors which were immunosuppressive and encountered issues including off-target effects , toxicity , lack of specificity , and the potential for severe medical complications. The reason for these issues is because targeting these kinases with specificity and without disrupting normal cellular functions is a complex task. Our Solution 1. Discovery of a new Binding Pocket Traditional kinase inhibitors focus on the ATP binding pocket with covalent bonding. Our platform allows us to identify new binding pockets where we can target specific functions using allosteric binding. 2. A unique & validated MOA (presented at ATS '23) GEn1E‚Äôs novel compounds bind to a unique binding site.

Model-Assisted Selection The Nucleus software platform helps science businesses reduce testing and accelerate wins by systematizing product development as learning to manipulate mechanisms. Our platform learns from your existing funnel testing data and a catalog of mechanisms mined from academic literature. We are working with: Systematizing Science with A.I. Our Technology Nucleus Learns Why Products Work: Hard Science How can I identify more promising products while testing fewer candidates? Outcome Reduce early stage testing Typical early-stage product funnels need to test a wide set of candidates--and this is expensive. We've found the root cause to be that we don't know which mechanisms will fulfill product requirements. Should a tastier strawberry produce more sugar or more flavor compounds? Nucleus drops losing candidates using in-silico simulation to reduce early stage testing. Nucleus for Hard Science Hard Science How can I advance candidates more quickly through phases? Outcome Accelerate pipeline advancements Typical product funnels require many successive phases of testing--and this is slow. We've found the root cause to be that mechanisms are entangled with each other and with the environment. Was this strawberry variety really tastier, or was it just a good year? Nucleus allows you to advance earlier by learning to disentangle mechanisms. It does this by combining your testing data with a simulation model built on a catalog of causal mechanisms mined from the academic literature. Nucleus for Hard Science Consumer Science Which promos and prices would drive incremental profits for Product? Outcome Increase gross margin up to 16% The Nucleus platform automatically quantifies price elasticity from historical data. Product teams use Nucleus optimizers and what-if scenarios to confidently plan promos that hit sales targets while preserving margin. Nucleus for Consumer Science Consumer Science Which half of agency spend is actually driving incremental sales from Media? Outcome Increase ROAS up to 411% The Nucleus platform automatically quantifies how every ad dollar drives incremental sales, including the effects of saturation, awareness and interaction with promos and season. Media teams can right-size and reallocate budgets to boost profits. Nucleus for Consumer Science What Nucleus ‚Äç clients are saying All testimonials Once we started using Nucleus for our ad spend budget planning, we saw immediate opportunities to improve ROAS.

Molecularly defining responders in Clinical Trials Clinical trials in cancer patients are challenging. Failure rates are high. Serious adverse events can occur frequently. However, even when a minority of patients respond to therapy, genomics could identify those patients for personalized therapy. We provide clinically translatable discovery genomics (DuoSeq), companion diagnostic development and FDA representation to enable the molecular definition of responders and patients at risk for significant adverse events. DuoSeq: Clinical DNA and RNA sequencing DuoSeq provides clinic-ready preparation of DNA and RNA sequencing libraries from a single specimen. Sequence whole exomes or selected gene panels (US FDA approval pending). DuoSeq includes a complete solution for bioinformatics and variant annotation. This enables any lab with a sequencer to perform DNA and RNA sequencing without major investments in biocomputing infrastructure and personnel.

                    every year, reminding me to send that photo to my wife.
                    For ten years you've helped ensure that there hasn't been
                    a single year of our marriage that my wife hasn't seen
                    those vows and is reminded that they mean as much to me

By automating repeatable tasks, computer vision enables outsized gains in human productivity. We are a team of machine perception & security experts applying leading-edge computer vision research to the needs of physical security organizations. We don‚Äôt do facial recognition. The privacy vs. security trade-off is a false dichotomy. You can respect individual privacy and increase group security. That‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt & won‚Äôt embrace facial recognition. We do always adapt to risk. Whether your immediate concern is everyday health and safety, employee tailgating, physical perimeter breaches or weapons detection, Ambient.ai has a threat signature. Ambient.ai threat signatures look for unexpected changes in human behavior. Behavior, combined with locations and location context, is used to identify emerging security incidents. With an expansive library of threat signatures, the Ambient.ai product is designed to adapt in real-time to an always changing risk landscape. Safety Falls & Medical Issues Resolution: Emergency services dispatched immediately. High Impact Alarm Reduction Resolution: Officers respond to AI-verified alerts ‚Äî not false alarms Medium Impact Perimeter Breach Resolution: Apprehended by local police before damage done. High Impact Weapon detection Resolution: Life threatening situation averted. PRODUCT OVERVIEW Introducing Ambient.ai, the always-on brain for your physical security systems. We‚Äôre not just technologists, we are product designers, developers & security practitioners ourselves. We wanted to move our teams from reactive to proactive security, so we designed a product with near-human visual perception. For the last two years, this product has been driving improved security outcomes for Global 2000 companies, world-class museums, data centers, schools, warehouses, & other types of physical locations. Why Ambient.ai Proactive Risk Alerts Reduce false alarms in real-time Use patent pending, full scene video context to control alarms, filtering out the noisy 99% and orchestrating real-time dispatch for real incidents. Graph-Powered Forensics Increase the speed of forensics post-incident. Use the visual attributes of any object in an incident to efficiently search across locations and times to quickly review the video footage of what happened before and after the incident. Mobile Dispatch Dispatch security personnel with context. Empower responders by integrating video intelligence into your dispatches. Enable your team to see a video preview of the scene they‚Äôre walking into. Reduce false alarms 93%. Use patent pending, full scene video context to control alarms, filtering out the noisy 99% & orchestrating real-time dispatch for real incidents. Speed investigations by 90%. Use the visual attributes of objects to efficiently find every video moment where that object was present. Respond 10x faster. Empower responders by integrating video intelligence into your dispatches. Enable your team to see a video preview of the scene they‚Äôre walking into. Designed to empower, not overwhelm your team. Today our security is limited by human capacity to manually translate streaming video into actionable information. After 12 minutes of continuous video monitoring an operator will miss up to 45% of screen activity. After 22 min of continuous viewing, up to 95% of screen activity is overlooked. Human attention is a scarce commodity. Alert fatigue is real. And in threat scenarios, seconds count. Ambient.ai is designed to deliver a product experience differentiated by human-machine collaboration. Every interface & workflow is thoughtfully crafted to lower adoption barriers, engage users on a human level, & enable teams to perform at their best in high stress scenarios. our customers Trusted by Fortune 500 Companies Ambient‚Äôs efficiencies allow us to execute a broader range of security and risk management activities, rather than having our personnel locked down behind a mountain of manual tasks and alarm noise. Rod Pearson Director of Global Security, Impossible Foods We were able to detect fence jumping. If you have operators and they are monitoring cameras, a fence jump is going to take 30 seconds ‚Äì they are not going to catch that. The only thing that can do that is an AI system. Ted Richie Director of Technical Operations, NorCal Cannabis What Ambient.ai gives us is the ability to see not only when someone is jumping a fence, but also what they were doing way before that, like when they were loitering with their car outside.

CODE THE BODY CAN RUN BIOS IT4 DATASET Visualisation by Andreas Nicolas Fischer Anchor 1 Decades ago, DNA sequencing opened up a new field of precision medicine. Now, AI is doing the same for the nervous system and BIOS is at the forefront, building the infrastructure on which future neural treatments will be discovered, developed, and delivered. ‚Äã The brain sends our bodies vast amounts of information every second of every day, but when those signals are faulty it can cause our organs and systems to malfunction, causing disease. BIOS has developed neural interfaces and AI that, for the first time, can read and write the body‚Äôs neural data, or ‚Äòcode‚Äô, to understand and correct those signals in real-time. ‚Äã BIOS envisions a new field of digital health treatments that use this new data-driven insight from the nervous system to create better, more targeted medicine. Neural digital therapies will use our read/write software to understand the effects on the nerves, leading to more precise creation of pharmaceuticals and software-delivered treatments direct to the nervous system. Autonomic Therapy REAL-TIME INSIGHTS With our proprietary neural interface and AI platform, BIOS has the unique ability to measure and analyse neural data in real-time in both acute and chronic settings. NEURAL BIOMARKERS BIOS has developed a programming language or 'code' for the nervous system that can be used for discovering groundbreaking insights into diseases, and creating new treatments. PRECISION HEALTH Neural digital therapeutics are created by using real-time feedback from the nervous system. This makes better, more targeted drugs, and opens the door for software-delivered therapies. HUMAN TECHNOLOGY We envision a future where we have control over our bodies and lives, enabling radically improved, seamlessly experienced healthcare. We want a better quality of life for everyone living with lifelong conditions. ECG RESPIRATORY PRESSURE BLOOD GLUCOSE Tech NEURAL CONTROL OF THE HEART Cardiovascular diseases are responsible for a third of all deaths globally.

1226,OneChronos,The Smart Market for Institutional Investors,OneChronos is a U.S. equities ATS designed bottom-up to fundamentally address the growing gap between how trading venues match orders and how traders need to execute.,S16,Active,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Fintech', 'Marketplace']",New York,US,,2,"['Stephen Johnson', 'Kelly Littlepage']",14.0,https://www.onechronos.com/,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/one-chronos,https://www.linkedin.com/company/onechronos/,"Home The Smart Market for Institutional Investors OneChronos is a U.S. equities ATS designed bottom-up to fundamentally address the growing gap between how trading venues match orders and how traders need to execute. Watch Intro A fair, intelligent, and customizable ATS. OneChronos is a Smart Market ‚Äì the technical term for markets that match counterparties using mathematical optimization. Smart Markets have a proven ability to outperform traditional markets on metrics such as price improvement, liquidity, trade size, and fairness. Smart Markets enable Expressive Bidding ‚Äì a tool that gives market participants the fidelity of voice trading and the advantages of an electronic venue. All market participants can benefit from the unique liquidity that Expressive Bidding generates. Proven results. Smart Markets have been increasingly adopted in sectors such as manufacturing, logistics, telecom, and advertising given their demonstrated ability to: Identify mutually beneficial outcomes for buyers and sellers Address agency issues and reduce incentives for gaming Directly handle substitutes and complements, unlocking transactions that wouldn‚Äôt be possible otherwise Mitigate information leakage and asymmetry OneChronos is pioneering the use of Nobel prize-winning (Economic Sciences, 2020) combinatorial auction techniques and artificial intelligence in financial markets, operating a Smart Market at a speed, scale and computational complexity that was not possible until now. Many Needs, One Solution. OneChronos offers brokers and their clients a simple mechanism to enhance their existing algorithms ‚Äî VWAP, IS, liquidity seeking, and multi-objective execution ‚Äî and accomplish diverse trading goals: Market impact modulation Single-security indifference curves Synthetic creation and redemption of ETFs Pairs and spread trading Multi-security portfolio execution and hedging Examples and details can be found in our Expressive Bidding Guide . Standard workflow, game changing paradigm Point-in-time auctions every ~100ms throughout the trading day Match priority based on aggregate notional price improvement contributed All matches are within or at the NBBO at a single clearing price per symbol Customizable constraints to isolate specific execution objectives based on inputs such as imbalance, spread, price dislocation, or quote fade (NBBO consensus) Fully non-displayed. No data feeds. Firm orders only. Multilateral fills Seamless fit in today‚Äôs algorithm & routing workflows. Standard order types supported, in addition to those unique to OneChronos. All orders via FIX 4.2 Single auction process spanning all orders & eligible NMS securities Differentiated liquidity, customized fills, unique trading opportunities FAQ Auction Mechanics, Match Procedure & Order Types How are OneChronos periodic auctions initiated? And at what frequency? OneChronos matches orders using periodic auctions. All auctions are
initiated by the venue at deliberately randomized start times; auctions are not
user-initiated. OneChronos aims to conduct an average of 10 auctions per second
throughout the trading day. Each auction considers all symbols and eligible
orders. How are orders matched on OneChronos ATS? What is the ‚Äúmatch priority‚Äù model? OneChronos auctions use mathematical optimization to seek optimal matches across
all orders, instead of matching orders one-by-one. The optimization‚Äôs objective
is to maximize Aggregate Price Improvement (see dedicated question for
definition) across all orders and symbols. Each auction looks for the
configuration of ‚Äúwinning‚Äù orders and per-security clearing prices that will
result in the most price improvement dollars cleared, taking into account all
orders‚Äô constraints. What order types are available at OneChronos? The ATS accepts Limit Orders, Peg Orders (Midpoint, Primary, and Market), and
Expressive Orders: an order type specific to OneChronos that allows participants
to introduce their business-specific execution instructions to our optimizer, spanning
one or more orders in one or more securities. How is Aggregate Price Improvement defined? For an individual order, Price Improvement Dollars refers to the difference
between the limit price on the order and the auction clearing price (i.e. the
price at which the order is filled) for the given security, times the quantity
filled. For an Expressive Order to buy and/or sell multiple securities
simultaneously, price improvement refers to differences in limit prices and
clearing prices for each respective security, summed across all securities times
the quantities filled. Aggregate Price Improvement represents the sum of Price Improvement Dollars
across all eligible orders (across all securities) under consideration for a
given auction. What is a Smart Market? A Smart Market is a periodic auction solved using a powerful operations
research technique called mathematical optimization. As used in many areas
of electronic trading and portfolio management, optimization allows for
maximization (or minimization) of a specifically defined objective, while
respecting a set of constraints. In the case of the OneChronos ATS, we‚Äôre
extending this robust application to the venue level where buyer‚Äôs & seller‚Äôs
orders meet. The OneChronos optimization‚Äôs primary objective is to identify,
match and clear the configuration of buy and sell orders which would maximize
Aggregate Price Improvement achievable by those orders in a given auction. Smart Markets have been deployed commercially dating back to the 1990s by
various large cap industries and government procurement auctions of physical
commodities to achieve the benefits we describe above, and continue to grow in
adoption given their proven success towards those goals. Where within or outside the spread can orders match? Orders can match at any price within the spread, at or between the NBB and NBO.
All orders in each security match at a single price in each auction. Orders
can be filled at prices better than their limit price, because of how prices
are determined via optimization. Does the ATS support Immediate-or-Cancel (IOC) Orders? Yes. OneChronos supports time-in-force (TIF) instructions such as: Day,
Immediate or Cancel (IOC), Fill or Kill, Good ‚ÄòTil Date (with an expire time not
to exceed the end of the current trading session). IOC orders effectively
participate in a single auction occurrence. For a complete list of TIF
instructions, see our FIX documentation . Where can I see some examples of how the auction determines match priority? Please see Part 3 Item 11 our ATS-N filing under the
heading ‚ÄúPRIORITY AND PRICE FORMATION EXAMPLE‚Äù . How might my order be price improved? The primary goal of the OneChronos matching process is to find the configuration
of orders that yield the most Aggregate Price Improvement as compared to their
respective limit prices. As each auction results in a single clearing price
for each security, eligible orders may receive fills at a price better than
their limit price. How are Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning techniques used by OneChronos? OneChronos is a Smart Market leveraging the power of optimization search
techniques to match and clear buyer‚Äôs and seller‚Äôs orders efficiently and
in a way that maximizes Aggregate Price Improvement achievable by those orders. The optimization problem these auctions pose is ‚Äúcomputationally intractable‚Äù,
because the flexible ‚ÄúExpressive Bidding‚Äù that the ATS allows for creates an
astronomical number of possible matches to search through. Traditionally,
these optimizations are solved using a technique called integer programming
and would run for hours or days at a time. To operate at the speed of equities markets and to scale effectively,
OneChronos uses AI in an effort to guide our optimizer toward areas of that
search space containing higher quality matches, and ultimately better
satisfy the objective of maximizing Aggregate Price Improvement. How is the 2020 Nobel Prize in Economics work related to the auction type used by OneChronos? In October 2020, the Nobel Prize in Economic Science was awarded to two Stanford
academics, Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson, for their improvements to auction
theory and inventions of new auction formats. Their research in game theory and
auction theory and their advancements in practical auction formats underpin the
Smart Market. We at OneChronos are elated at both their deserving receipt of the prize and the
validation of their inventions‚Äô contributions to marketplaces of all kinds. You can learn more about the 2020 Nobel Prize in
Economics here ,
and greater detail on Wilson and Milgrom‚Äôs research and auction
formats here . More Trading at OneChronos Can orders persist for multiple OneChronos auctions? For example, those not matched or not fully executed in a OneChronos auction. Yes, orders with residual (‚Äúleaves‚Äù) quantity can persist for the duration
of the trading day for successive auctions. Time in force instructions and
default values are described, per our FIX specification,
found here . What types of participants are anticipated to use OneChronos? While only broker-dealers may be direct subscribers, the OneChronos
participant base is anticipated to consist primarily of institutional
customers of broker-dealers, and broker-dealers themselves including franchise
risk management teams, equity and options market makers and specialists. As
it pertains to their agency offering, broker-dealers may offer OneChronos
as a complement to their single stock or multi-asset algorithm and
smart-routing products, and as a DMA destination. Please speak with your
broker for further info on how OneChronos is incorporated in their execution
services offerings. How does the ATS determine which orders are eligible in an auction? What happens to orders received after the auction cutoff? The ATS system chooses auction cutoff times at random within a pre-set range.
Any orders that have a timestamp prior to the auction cutoff are eligible.
Orders timestamped after the auction cutoff time are eligible to participate
in the subsequent auction. How does cancel-replace work during the auction life-cycle? Is there a lock-up period? Each auction consists of buffer time for inbound market data and order data,
followed by the optimization sequence, then outbound execution and order data.
Continuous order management is available throughout this full life-cycle.
However, any order not canceled or cancel / replaced prior to the initiation
of the optimization sequence will take effect in the subsequent auction. Who can access OneChronos directly? All OneChronos subscribers must be SEC registered Broker Dealers and members of
at least one SRO. All orders received by the ATS are received from Subscribers
(including those originated from their customers). Institutions that are not SEC broker dealers can access OneChronos through
their broker. Institutions can, however, directly convey ‚Äúexpressive‚Äù
constraints to complement orders they may send to their broker for execution
at OneChronos in effort to achieve a customized fill experience. See our FAQ
section on Expressive Bidding for further information. Can I send DMA orders through my broker for potential execution at OneChronos ATS? Yes. Please speak with your broker regarding their DMA offering and OneChronos
as a destination. Directing DMA orders for execution at OneChronos allows for
Institutions or Brokers to tailor execution constraints specific to their
risk management and execution objectives.
See FAQ section on Expressive Bidding for further detail. Does the OneChronos ATS use tiering or segmentation? OneChronos does not use tiering or segmentation. Does OneChronos ATS offer Conditional Indications? All orders sent to OneChronos are firm orders. Does OneChronos ATS send out Indications of Interest? OneChronos does not send out indications of interest or indications of
contra-liquidity. Auctions happen throughout the trading day as determined by
the matching engine. See section Auction Mechanics, Match Procedure & Order
Types for further information. How is liquidity taking and liquidity providing defined and considered in the matching process? OneChronos auctions do not have a notion of adding or removing liquidity, and do
not categorize participants as liquidity providers or liquidity takers. See
our FAQ section on Auction Mechanics, Match Procedure & Order Types to better
understand the OneChronos auction process. Does OneChronos support Odd lots or Mixed Lots? OneChronos does accept odd-lot and mixed-lot orders. The minimum trade size
is 1 share. Both odd-lot and mixed-lot orders are treated and handled in
the same manner as round lot orders. Does OneChronos support Min Quantity? Yes, available on all orders. What happens when Residual quantity of an order falls below Min Quantity? The order will be cancelled in the manner configured by the user through FIX
port settings. Does OneChronos have a self-cross prevention feature? Yes. See the FIX documentation for order handling details. What securities does OneChronos ATS accommodate? OneChronos supports NMS securities, including single stocks, ETFs and ADRs. Can OneChronos accept or rank orders priced in increments smaller than $0.01 (sub-penny)? No. Rule 612 (¬ß 242.612 Minimum pricing increment) of SEC Regulation NMS
expressly prohibits brokers, exchanges, and alternative trading systems from
accepting, displaying, or ranking quotes or orders for any NMS stock priced in
an increment smaller than $0.01 for stocks priced greater than or equal to
$1.00. OneChronos trades only NMS stocks priced greater than or equal to $5.00,
so Rule 612 applies uniformly. OneChronos will reject any order not priced in
increments of $0.01. Can OneChronos match orders at prices that are not in increments of $0.01 or allow Expressive Bidding constraints that can result in sub-penny executions? Yes. The OneChronos match mechanism, as detailed in our Form ATS-N, is not
restricted to establishing clearing prices in increments of $0.01. The
possibility of sub-penny clearing prices is consistent with Rule 612 of NMS,
which governs the minimum pricing of quotes and orders. However, it does not
impose any restrictions on execution prices. All OneChronos executions are
average priced, computed to six decimal places using the formula: average price
= total notional paid or received/total shares transacted. Note that any order
can fill at its limit price or better, which could be a sub-penny price, as a
function of the OneChronos match process (see dedicated FAQ question). Also,
through Expressive Bidding, a OneChronos user can impose constraints on an
execution that can result in fills at sub-penny average prices. As such,
Expressive Bidding can guarantee that an order executes at a sub-penny price or
better but cannot be used to ensure execution at a specific price, sub-penny or
otherwise. Do you have examples demonstrating situations in which sub-penny executions can occur? Yes. First, note that before formulating the optimization problem used to
determine the matches and clearing prices for a given auction, OneChronos will
round coefficients in the objective function (down for an order to buy and up
for an order to sell) to increments of $0.01. The following examples are
non-exhaustive and meant to illustrate specific situations in which executions
can and cannot occur at sub-penny prices. Example 1: User A submits a buy order of 300 at 10.01. User B submits a sell
order of 100 at 10.00. User C submits a sell order of 100 at 10.00. The auction
clears 200 shares at 10.006. Example 2: User submits a Target Order to buy 100 shares at $10.01 with the
Expressive Bidding constraint that 10.005*fill_quantity ‚â§ $1,000.505. The
User‚Äôs notional value contribution to the objective function is
$10.01*fill_quantity. Example 3: User submits a Target Order to buy 100 shares at $10.01
all-or-none at a total notional value ‚â§ $1,000.50. The User‚Äôs notional value
contribution to the objective function is $1,000.50 if the order fills and $0.00
otherwise. Such an order can only fill at an average price of $10.005 or better. Example 4: User submits a Target Order to buy 100 shares at $10.01
all-or-none at a total notional value ‚â§ $1,000.500001. Before computing match
priority, OneChronos will round the max notional value contributed down to
$1,000.50; if the Target Order was a sell and the constraint was total notional
value ‚â• $1,000.500001, OneChronos would round up to $1,000.51. Does OneChronos pass back a liquidity indicator on executions? OneChronos does not pass back a liquidity indicator on executions, as it does not
have a concept of adding or removing liquidity in its auctions. Given the duration of the OneChronos auction lifecycle how can I increase my likelihood of fills on OneChronos? Orders with a duration of less than 100ms may experience a lower likelihood of
being filled at OneChronos. Note, however, that continuous order management is available throughout the
full auction life-cycle, and without any ‚Äúqueue‚Äù penalty, as orders at
OneChronos are not matched on the basis of time priority. Orders timestamped after the auction cutoff time are eligible to participate
in the subsequent auction(s). Similarly, any order not cancelled or cancel/
replaced prior to the auction cutoff time will take effect in the
subsequent auction. Orders may be tagged to participate in only one auction (‚ÄúIOC‚Äù), or persist
for subsequent auctions for any specified period up to the end of the day‚Äôs
trading session. More Trade Reporting, Visibility & Transparency Where does OneChronos ATS print its trades? ATS executions are printed to the FINRA NYSE TRF. What data is disseminated through public trading reporting? OneChronos publicly (through TRF) disseminates the execution price and total
volume matched for each security in each auction. Individual participants also
receive execution reports with their individual fill quantity within that total. Where can I view Form ATS-N for OneChronos ATS? The OneChronos Form ATS-N filed with the SEC can be found
at this link . What is the OneChronos ATS MPID? The MPID for OneChronos is: CGXS What is the OneChronos ATS MIC Code? The MIC Code for OneChronos is: CGXS More Data Center, Market Data & Routing Where is the OneChronos matching engine located? The OneChronos matching engine is located at Equinix NY5. Does OneChronos ATS route any orders externally? For example, those not matched in a OneChronos auction. OneChronos does not route orders externally. How is NBBO calculated? The NBBO prices used in OneChronos auctions are the SIP derived prices most
recent to but not after the Auction Initialization Time. As an illustrative
example of this procedure: Auction Initialization results in an auction cutoff time; Auction Network Buffering allows data to propagate from exchanges, to the
SIP, and ultimately to the OneChronos ATS; After buffering the ATS computes NBBO for each tradable symbol by processing
all messages from the SIP with Exchange Timestamps less than or equal to the
cutoff time for the auction. Does OneChronos offer co-location? OneChronos allows Subscribers to connect directly to the ATS via cross-connect
or extranet. Note: we are starting with a single PoP, however the system is developed to
support expansion to multiple PoPs across the country. Where does OneChronos get its Market Data? Does OneChronos ATS maintain direct market data feeds? OneChronos constructs a view of NBBO from data provided by the SIP (NYSE CTA
feeds & Nasdaq UTP). Each SIP message contains a timestamp provided by the
reporting exchange representing when that exchange processed the given message.
OneChronos market data and matching systems use these Exchange Timestamps in
conjunction with the buffering period prior to each auction in an effort to
construct a consistent time-aligned view of the market. The ATS does not
subscribe to direct feeds from the national exchanges. Does OneChronos provide any data feeds? OneChronos does not provide any data feeds (for example, to its Subscribers). More Connectivity How can OneChronos be accessed? Subscribers access OneChronos via a standard FIX (4.2) connection. Customers of
Subscribers access OneChronos indirectly via their Broker‚Äôs execution products
and services, which may include: single stock or multi-asset algorithms, where
portions of that order may be routed to OneChronos for execution from the
Broker‚Äôs router; a Broker‚Äôs Direct-to-SOR offering which may route orders to
OneChronos for execution; or a Broker‚Äôs Direct Market Access (‚ÄúDMA‚Äù) offering,
where a Broker‚Äôs clients may direct orders to OneChronos or other destinations
using their own algorithms and or routing. Are there any special requirements for order submission via FIX? No. Orders sent to OneChronos ATS for execution are transmitted using standard
FIX protocol. See our FIX specification here for further information. What are the hours of operation for OneChronos ATS? Standard Market Hours (US Eastern time): 8:00am: begin accepting FIX connections / sessions; 9:15am: begin accepting orders; 9:30am: begin executing orders (i.e. first call auction will take place at
or after 9:30am); 4:00pm: stop executing orders (i.e. final call auction will take place at or
before 4:00pm); 5:00pm: all FIX sessions disconnected. Expressive Bidding What is Expressive Bidding? How should I consider if Expressive Bidding is relevant for how I trade? Expressive bidding allows users to input specific execution instructions at
the matching engine level that are precisely tailored to their execution or
investment strategy objectives. For example, a pairs trader could effect instructions to buy asset ABC
(subject to the price & quantity in her ABC limit order) only if she can
also sell asset DEF (subject to the price & quantity in her DEF limit order)
at a defined spread or greater, in the same auction. A single stock trader, as another example, may have indifference between
specific prices and order quantities, and therefore effect instructions
to BUY 100 shares asset XYZ at mid OR BUY 300 shares Asset XYZ at 60% of
the spread. Example use-cases to complement benchmark, liquidity seeking and multi-asset
algorithms, as well as parameter-specific strategies like dollar-neutrality
and substitution within a basket are available here on our Expressive Bidding page. Expressive Bidding is communicated to the OneChronos matching engine using a
general purpose programming language (Reason ML or OCaml). Users
(clients of Brokers or Brokers themselves) can construct and
tailor execution instructions relevant to them or their clients. Is Expressive Bidding required to trade at OneChronos? Expressive bidding is not required to trade at OneChronos. It is an optional
and powerful feature available to Subscribers and their customers. It allows
users to integrate their specific execution or investment constraints
directly into our matching engine. Can / Does my broker use Expressive Bidding to complement its trading algorithm or smart routing strategies? There are myriad creative implementations Brokers may use to complement and
strengthen their single stock and multi-asset execution offerings and their
related customizations. Please speak with your Broker to learn how OneChronos
is incorporated in their execution services offerings. Is Expressive Bidding something I would use directly, or through my broker? Please speak with your broker on how they might incorporate Expressive Bidding
for general use or on a customized basis to complement their trading algorithms
or smart routing for single stock or multi-asset strategies. If your firm is accustomed to computer-driven trading or execution, Expressive
Bids, written in ReasonML or OCaml, should integrate well and may feel
syntactically similar to Python, Java, or C++. You can construct tailored bidder logic or leverage your broker to complement
orders you send to them for potential execution at OneChronos. Can my Limit price or Quantity ever be violated? No. The economics of your Limit Order or Limit Orders serve as an upper or lower
bound (as relevant) for any order, including those using Expressive Bidding to
create conditionality across multiple limit orders. Is Expressive Bidding required to achieve the benefits OneChronos discusses; price improvement, mitigated impact, unique crossing opportunities? Expressive bidding is not required to achieve the benefits or differentiation
that OneChronos represents. The OneChronos matching engine and mechanism is
designed to find price improvement opportunities, mitigate information
leakage, and create unique interaction opportunities for any order type. Expressive Bidding allows further execution customization with powerful
application to users who are trading substitutable or complementary assets
or orders or portions of larger orders. Is there benefit to interacting with other orders which are using Expressive Bidding? Yes, there is potential benefit for a variety of reasons such as but not
limited to potential further price improvement achievable, larger fill
size, a customized fill experience, reduced impact, unique liquidity
interaction points, and unlocking mutually beneficial trades that would
likely otherwise not occur, as in this example: Trader A wants to de-risk her healthcare sector exposure. Traditionally,
she enters individual parent SELL orders in one or more healthcare stocks
through a trading algorithm or to market center. Alternatively, Trader A
sends limit orders to OneChronos across 10 healthcare names, with Expressive
Bidding instructions to trade any combination of those names up to $20mm
(subject to the limit prices and quantities in her limit orders). Trader
B sends a standard BUY limit order to OneChronos for a specific healthcare
stock. Both Trader A and Trader B have a higher likelihood of a fill given
Trader A‚Äôs expressed substitutability across related assets. Can OneChronos help me construct Expressive Bid constraints? Are there existing templates? Tutorials? Yes, OneChronos provides recorded and live support for bid construction.
We also provide templates for common trading and execution strategies that
can be modified for use in production. A great place to begin is with the introductory content and customizable
templates available in the introduction to our Expressive Bidding site. Please feel free to reach out to us at [email¬†protected] to discuss

Developed by Domain Experts Neda Razavi, MBA CEO Linkedin Twitter Shadi Saberi, PhD Founder, CTO Linkedin Ray Hu, MBA Dir. of Software Linkedin Andrew Leynes, PhD Dir. of Machine Learning Linkedin Meet the Team ‚ÄúATUSA provides a window into the activity of cancer‚Äù As a son of a breast cancer victim, I can‚Äôt emphasize enough the importance of more available and frequent breast cancer screening and monitoring. My mother suffered from the unfortunate consequence of believing she was in remission when her breast cancer returned unbeknownst to her. ATUSA provides a window into the activity of cancer, and, more importantly, builds from this a cancer profile previously unknown to physicians and patients alike. Lance M. Black, MD, MBID TMC Innovation Institute Frequently Asked Questions Who is the ATUSA System designed for? Initially, the ATUSA system is aimed at physicians offices and women‚Äôs health clinics to allow for fast and convenient whole breast imaging at the point of care. The ATUSA system is fully automated, easy to operate and is meant to be used by physicians, nurses, and medical assistants. What are the components of the ATUSA system? The ATUSA system is made up of a 3D ultrasound scanner, a wearable accessory, a Windows application (desktop and tablet, Windows 7 and higher) for real-time image display, review and measurement and a secure web application for remote viewing with advanced 3D visualization How does the ATUSA system work? First, the patient attaches the wearable accessory and lies on her back. The operator then adjusts the breast tissue, applies coupling medium and attaches the 3D scanner. When the scanner is ready, it can be started from the ATUSA software with the press of a button to automatically image the whole breast volume, which takes approximately two minutes. This procedure can then be repeated on the patient‚Äôs other breast. Where can I try and/or purchase the ATUSA system? Physicians, women‚Äôs health clinics and other relevant health care professionals can get access to the device by registering for a free demo or registering their interest to participate in the ATUSA pilot program . The ATUSA system is currently only available for investigational use and is not yet available for sale. What kind of training is required to use ATUSA? The ATUSA system does not require a radiologist or ultrasound technologist for image acquisition. ATUSA comes with comprehensive instructional videos for system operation and an initial live demo/training session. However, interpretation of images requires a physician with training in breast ultrasound. How does the ATUSA scanner connect to my tablet or laptop? Is internet connectivity required to use the System? The ATUSA system connects to your tablet or laptop via USB and does not require an internet connection. Acquired images are saved locally on your device and are automatically backed up to a HIPAA-compliant secure cloud storage when connected to the internet. Regulatory FDA 510(k) Cleared The ATUSA system has received FDA 510(k) clearance. *AI features described in this website are in the research phase of development and have not been demonstrated safe or effective for clinical use.

747,20n,Using AI to predict biochemistry for manufacturing and therapeutics,"The next decade is going to see a biotech revolution fueled by three technologies: ability to read DNA (sequencing), ability to write DNA (synthesis), and computational systems that predict what DNA to read and write. With sequencing and synthesis being mainstream now [1], 20n provides the computational systems that predict DNA design for novel industrial biotech and health applications.

At 20n, we are taking a fresh look at turning biological data into information. We approach it as a big data learning problem, and bring to bear techniques from machine learning, distributed systems, AI planning, program synthesis, data mining, and natural language processing. With the support of DARPA [2], we are building a team of computer scientists, and bioengineers to look at biology in fundamentally new ways.

Our current customers include industrial biotech firms that are leading the charge in transitioning us from traditional unsustainable means of manufacturing to sustainable biological processes leading to advanced fuels, materials, therapeutics, and flavors and fragrances. 20n‚Äôs technology helps them enter markets previously thought inaccessible for biology.

[1] Sequencing DNA costs $4k/genome (http://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts/) and is expected to go down to $1k/genome. Synthesizing DNA is at 20cents/bp, and is expected to go down to 0.1cents/bp.

                        using the best educational ideas. 1 We find the best ideas for you. So far, you have been burdened with constantly needing to find better ways
                            to make your students succeed. You scour the internet late into the night,
                            seek and attend a lot of professional development, and frequently change
                            how or what you teach. Often, a lot of what you come across is either
                            expensive or is less relevant and hard to grasp and implement. We find, simplify, and curate contextually-relevant ideas for your day-to-day
                            teaching. These ideas include findings from research and practice on
                            pedagogical strategies, curriculum design, content knowledge, equity,
                            student needs, excellent lesson planning, and meeting standards you intend
                            to align with. We believe the difference between insufficient education and great
                            educational experiences is a lot of these small ideas in practice. So you can take a breather. 2 We help you and your colleagues use these ideas with your students. Normally, new educational ideas are shared with complex one-size-fits-all
                            action plans that require you and your colleagues to change your practices
                            entirely. They don‚Äôt build around the lives of the students, the philosophy, the culture, and
                            the learning models at your school. We do things differently. Our simple planning tool puts the power in your
                            hands. It lets you pick bite-sized ideas to place in your curricular plans
                            and assessments. It then helps you link all the plans and
                            ideas together, so you and your school can bring them to life in your
                            instructional practice. So you can revive your energy. 3 We do high-tech wizardry in the background to make this happen. a We capture, catalog, and vet the most important ideas found in research
                            papers, evidence from classroom practice, publisher and teacher-authored
                            curriculum, and classroom stories. Learn how . b We use a first-of-its-kind underlying universal language for curriculum,
                            instruction, and assessment, to express these ideas and make them
                            transcend borders. Learn how . c We surface and sprinkle these ideas on a magic canvas‚Äîour free planning
                            tool‚Äîthat gives you and your team planning superpowers. These
                            superpowers help you recognize gaps, draw connections, and offer the very
                            best learning experiences to all your students. And we build a better
                            understanding of what improving curriculum involves, so we can add

Store associates can‚Äôt identify what‚Äôs on the sales floor vs. in the stockroom in real-time, let alone find misplaced items in real-time. 2.Stores have not become reliable fulfillment centers for e-commerce orders, even as e-commerce orders become a larger portion of your sales. 3.

29157,Orbio Earth,Tracking methane emissions with satellites,"Orbio Earth has developed a software platform that uses satellites to monitor methane emissions from the energy industry.

Credit &¬†Equity Investors For investors asking how to invest into energy companies in the future. Orbio benchmarks existing energy portfolios on emission performance, and models related transitional risks. Oil &¬†Gas Operators Orbio equips oil & gas operators with real-time data to pre-emptively address emission risks, ensuring compliance and safeguarding against regulatory repercussions. How Our Platform¬†Works A three step journey to environmental clarity. Learn more OUR¬†PLATFORM From Data to Insight Learn more about how we generate decision-useful data on energy portfolios from every existing public satellite in space. Stanford CASE¬†STUDY How Orbio Earth creates market-leading emissions data with global, asset-level satellite imagery We‚Äôve found ways to extract the methane signal from satellite data that allows us to scan every oil & gas facility in the globe every couple of days. Key to this has been ensuring our data is the highest quality, and our recent study with Stanford University was a validation of these efforts. The problem The Underreported Crisis of Methane Emissions Financial and energy sectors rely on generic emission calculation methods making it difficult to manage risks rising from methane regulation sweeping the globe. There are 12 million oil & gas facilities globally capable of emitting methane emissions, and a huge amount go under the radar. Traditional methods fall short in accurately reporting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, leading to a staggering underreporting of up to 70%. ‚Äç As the world braces for stringent regulations with significant financial repercussions, such as the impending IRA methane fee in the US and forthcoming EU regulation , the immediate need for precision in methane emission benchmarking has never been more critical. Our partners and collaborators Frequently asked questions How does the Orbio Earth platform work? Orbio utilises satellite data to capture images of methane every 4 days from any site on earth. We then reconcile this satellite emissions data with emission factor datasets to provide better emission benchmarks of assets, companies and supply chains . Why is understanding methane emissions important? Reducing man-made methane emissions are a win for both the climate and companies in the energy and financial sectors. Stopping these emissions from the energy industry alone could prevent 0.2¬∞C of global warming. To put that into perspective, it would be like taking all cars and trucks off the road globally. Preventing these emissions are surprisingly simple when stakeholders are equipped with the right data. How is Orbio Earth different? Firstly Orbio can deliver data at high spatial resolutions meaning emissions can be attributed to specific assets . The main methane-specific satellite in use today gives regional scale resolutions making it very difficult to gauge where the source of methane emissions are coming from. Secondly, Orbio has begun reconciling emissions data with non-emission datasets to inform how existing reporting efforts and aid with risk identification . How can I get involved with Orbio Earth? We are open to any connections! Find us on Linkedin, Crunchbase and Twitter, or drop us a line on info@orbio.earth, we are always keen on talking to people who are interested in tackling the methane problem. Why are current methane emission estimates so inaccurate Because estimating methane emissions is very difficult! There are three main reasons for this: 1. The nature of events are quite random , it can be from a leaking valve to a maintenance event, to a blowout. 2. There are 12 million energy assets worldwide that can emit methane . Therefore it's difficult to capture accurate data about emissions across such large scales. 3. Lastly, the majority of methane emissions are un-reported events , therefore, usually, they are not taken into account by current estimates. What sort of business risks can methane emissions create There are three examples that can be pointed to here: ‚Äç 1. Regulatory Pressure is increasing - after CO26 and the Global methane pledge, which 100 countries signed, methane regulations are being introduced creating transitional risks for companies. This transitional risk and regulatory pressure is in turn leading to shareholders pressuring businesses to better account for methane in their supply chain. 2. Unaccounted methane emissions can lead to drops in company valuations. Diversified energy recently suffered a $300m drop in its share price after it was found to have higher methane emissions in its supply chain than reported. 3. Companies are backing out of purchasing decisions based on methane emission risk. Engie recently backed out of an energy deal with NextDecade after fears over the methane emissions within the companies supply chain Sign up to our newsletter.

Unlock a high conversion marketing channel High purchase intent Developers read open source docs when they are looking for a tool. Marketing via open source docs allows you to capture their intent to adopt new tools. Targeted audience Only developers read open source docs. You get much higher quality leads than any other ads channel. These leads actually convert into deals. Recurring value Open source projects attract a stable stream of new users. Sponsorship lets you reach them and creates a recurring flow of new users for you. WHY¬†DEVMARK? We make open source sponsorship easy and transparent Streamline project discovery and negotiations Open source sponsorship can involve a lot of work:¬†finding the right projects, contacting the maintainers, and negotiating back-and-forth. Devmark uses AI¬†to match your product with open source projects that your users will check out, and handles all the negotiations to make the deals happen. Find the right projects among millions on GitHub. Discover dozens of relevant projects your audience frequents that you didn't know about. Take advantage of opportunities to present your product naturally in documentation, not just a logo in the README No more back-and-forth:¬†devmark handles all the negotiations See metrics before you sponsor No more guessing how many users are using a GitHub repo from its star history.

STEP¬†2 Sponsor a curated portfolio of projects We handle all the negotiations to get your product mentioned organically in the docs. STEP¬†3 Monitor the ROI of your sponsorships We help you monitor sponsorship metrics and iterate on the best messaging. FAQ How is devmark different from GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective? GitHub Sponsors and OpenCollective facilitate payments for open source sponsorship. Devmark is a layer on top and supports both for payments. Devmark is an end-to-end solution for companies. It finds the best projects for the target audience, and generates organic ways to embed the product messaging in open source docs. Why should I¬†find projects via devmark? You may be familiar with the most well-known open source projects. Unfortunately, they tend to have multiple sponsors and a high price tag. Devmark specializes in helping companies sponsor a range of medium-scale, underfunded projects for optimal ROI. Without devmark, you need to find needles in a haystack. How can I¬†make sure devmark sponsors the right projects? Devmark will present a portfolio of projects before starting sponsorship payments. You can remove projects that you don't want from your sponsorship portfolio at any time. What metrics can I see for the projects I¬†sponsor? The devmark platform tracks cost per impression (CPM) and cost per click (CPC) for all the sponsorship deals. We also use HTML¬†tags (e.g. UTM¬†links) to identify users that visited your website to help you measure the conversion and activation rate.

The world of tech research is currently facing a problem of too much information. It takes an arduous amount of time to iterate over possible state of the art research papers, because well.. every paper claims to be state of the art these days. 

You have to implement it in your own use case to see if it actually works for you. This is a slow process. We plan to make this process drastically faster by fundamentally changing the way engineers consume & reproduce technical articles to build software. Our early users are already exploring use cases in fields such as machine learning, embedded systems programming, biotech and quantitative finance.

We believe that in the next 5 years, much of technological innovation would not be in the form of writing code inside a terminal, but instead having conversations with powerful computer programs (much like Jarvis from Iron Man ü¶æ üöÄ).

Banking services provided by Thread Bank, Member FDIC. The Every Visa Business Debit Card is issued by Thread Bank, pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. and may be used anywhere Visa cards are accepted. For Every customers with deposit accounts on Thread Bank, your deposits qualify for up to a maximum of $2,500,000 in FDIC insurance coverage when placed at program banks in the Thread Bank deposit sweep program. Your deposits at each program bank become eligible for FDIC insurance up to $250,000, inclusive of any other deposits you may already hold at the bank in the same ownership capacity. You can access the terms and conditions of the sweep program at go.thread.bank/sweepdisclosure and a list of program banks at go.thread.bank/programbanks. Please contact customerservice@thread.bank with questions on the sweep program.‚Äù **Terms, conditions, and restrictions apply to earning cashback. Please see Cashback Rewards Program Terms & Conditions for more details. Atomic Invest LLC (‚ÄúAtomic‚Äù), through a clearing relationship with Pershing LLC (‚ÄúPershing‚Äù) offers a cash sweep program. Funds in transit to or from Program Banks are generally not FDIC-insured. The Sweep Program is administered by Pershing, LLC. Deposits at each Program Bank are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity. Based on eligibility criteria, the two FDIC-insured programs (‚ÄúBank Deposit Programs‚Äù) offered are 1) Dreyfus Insured Deposits (DIDI) and 2) Liquid Insured Deposits . Funds deposited into each sweep program, in aggregate, are eligible for up to $2,500,000 of FDIC insurance. The sweep programs can be configured so that once the funds reach one or more Program Banks (up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity at up to ten Program Banks), then the next Bank Deposit Program is initiated. Although certain types of accounts, such as trust accounts may be eligible for additional FDIC insurance based on the number of beneficiaries, funds will be allocated to each Program Bank in such a way that provides up to $250,000 of FDIC insurance for individual accounts and $250,000 of FDIC insurance for trust and other corporate account types, in each case per Program Bank. If clients elect to exclude one or more Program Banks from receiving deposits the amount of FDIC insurance available through the Atomic Invest account may be lower. Clients are responsible for monitoring their total assets at each Program Bank, including existing deposits held at Program Banks outside of the Atomic Invest account, to ensure FDIC insurance limits are not exceeded, which could result in some funds being uninsured. For more information on FDIC insurance please visit www.FDIC.gov. Deposits held in Program Banks are not protected by SIPC. For more information see Pershing‚Äôs Terms and Conditions and the Atomic Invest Form ADV Part 2A . Yield is an annualized 16-week T-bill rate when held to maturity as of 03/28/24. The rate shown is subject to price fluctuation and is net of fees. T-bills are purchased at a discount to par, $1,000, with the price being subject to market fluctuation. The amount of T-Bills available at a particular yield will depend upon the sellers‚Äô offer size; any remaining cash balance after the purchase may not earn this yield.

Democratizing access to compute We want to democratize cloud compute across the world. We want to free builders from the the increasing barriers between them and compute, while increasing resource efficiency.¬† Developers should be able to set their preferences for cost, performance and other criteria and let Cedana take care of the rest. Similar systems to Cedana are in use at OpenAI, Microsoft Research, Meta and others. We help bring them to everyone else. Access to compute is increasingly a bottleneck to research and progress. There is a growing divide across academia, nations, companies and individuals that separates those with access and the ability to scale compute resources and those that don't. The importance of efficient compute utilization grows with the difficulty of modeling real-world complexity. We solve these issues by moving your compute in real-time across the world, building a global compute exchange. Enhance Efficiency Assign reliability, performance requirements and SLAs from individual jobs to entire tasks.
